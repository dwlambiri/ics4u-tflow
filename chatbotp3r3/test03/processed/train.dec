Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Where?
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Tons
The "real you".
Let's go.
I hope so.
Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
But you hate Joey
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You set me up.
I just wanted --
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Just for a minute
So they tell me...
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Get out!
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
He seems like he thrives on danger
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Are you lost?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Block E?
An attempted slit.
William didn't even go to high school
Neither has his heterosexuality.
No fear.
Who cares?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I told you
Why?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
You know what they say
What?
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
BIANCA
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Acting the way we do.
Then you screwed up
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You know what I mean
No what?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
What?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Which parts?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Yeah.  I guess.
Right.
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
You're not helping.
But -- who -- what --?
Did I have anything to say about it?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
There'll be a time.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
Then you are too ambitious.
... for a commoner?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Surely you can do anything you want.
Twenty eight.
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
Yes, but he was a cop.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What are you asking me?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
In the kitchen.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Who do you think, Chief?!
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was that, Korfin?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
It's okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
No, what is it?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Hmmmm.
My folks are.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
Something back home?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
No.  Are you proposing?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
Shut up.  Look!
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Ha. Ha.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Yeah?  What kind?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Clean?
You hear that question, Garcia?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
What the hell happened?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Yes.
Yes, I thought so.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Yes.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I see.
Well, I'm glad about that.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
Pros.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Come on.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
No way...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
One of  em's in the slam.
Doesn't look like it.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What's wrong with that?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
That's the way I see it, too.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Fuck you.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Billy, go ahead, break it...
First, the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Of course.
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
How many points you got left on your license?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
...'Scuse me?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Found it?
It's like a cab isn't it?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
To save the world.
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Why not?
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Uh..you're welcome.
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Apipoussan?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I want to sleep... forever...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You don't understand...
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
What?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
I'm telling you...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
Hmm.
Is it?
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
They should be here any minute.
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
Alright, Tom.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
What the fuck do you want from me?
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
You are a private investigator?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Yeah... guess so.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're learning.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I try to be.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
How are you?  Having any luck?
It got to be too much for him.
You should be.
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
No, sir, he is not.
Okay.  Fine.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
That obvious, huh?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Enough of that crap.
Earth to Alice...
Let me talk to you.
She knew she was gonna die.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
To take a picture.
Very funny.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Now.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
My baby!
That's their problem.
No shit.
My undying love.  Have some.
Makes you look like a nun--
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
My father!  He's not - ?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
Yes, Griff?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
I'll be another!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
No.
Chub says you're fired.
How soon?
This spring.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
We bought you.
That was me.
You think so.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Hmm.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Yeah.
On your sleeve.
What?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
I don't care. They're out.
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
It's stupid.
No what?
Jesus, why?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
It belongs to Pop.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
I know.
You're a policeman.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Where's Jill?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Of course! I would've heard.
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
You're not using it today?
When did she die?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
The other guy.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
She's coming.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
You and me.
Wade?
Twombley.
No shit.
Get some sleep.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Want to know what I think happened?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Don't you even want to ask?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
Daddy...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Stay cool.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
To swear you in as President.
Why?
Ga get it.
Any of us?
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You'll do it?
One thing I've learned as
Rose, I don't have time for this.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
What's the story?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
Sir?
Te...!
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Now!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
That's my girl.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
That's not possible.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
What...?
I'm sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Well...not for another two hours.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Ted!
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I love you.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
And a little ice!
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
Every day.
Good-bye, darling.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Yeah...
That's right.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
Yes...
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
Here?
Do it!
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing?
And that fits?
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Why'd I do what?
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
We all did.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
What's that?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
You?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Talk to me, Hudson.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
How long until it blows?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Well, thanks, I --
Hear me out...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Do it!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
You're just reading me.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Seal the door.
It's readin' right.  Look!
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What about me?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
Wah...?  Where are...?
I know, honey.  Me too.
Can we dream?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
Good morning.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
In a harem.
What's that?
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
The marriage!
What?
I'll be right back.
I'm so relieved.
I want to go!
Yes!
Why?
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
Yes, my love?
Why not? Half the house!
I heard voices.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Why not?
It's killing me.
I understand.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Isn't it obvious?
I was at hand.
And I'm asking you -
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Gertrude!
Michael!
Who was your teacher?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Ah-ha!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
I think so, Sire, yes.
And German?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Well. There it is.
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
Yes.
How many?
It's a secret.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Bene! Bene!
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Sssh! Stay here.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
Why not?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I can't say. Really
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
What dead? Who is dead?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I do.
No! No, it's him!
What man?
He knows. He knows!
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
What time?
Common time.
Sing it back.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
I think so.
Do you have it?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What is what?
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
I've seen the manuscript.
Never mind.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Well done, Sire!
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Is David acting strangely?
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I beg your pardon?
A wolf.
Yes?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
A werewolf?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Good.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Pull over.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
David, let's go now.
No.
No what?
No.
Right.
No what?
No!
I thought not.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
There's no call for that kind of language.
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
What are you going to see?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
So they said.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It's a five-pointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
I heard that.
What was it?
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's circling us.
Plan?
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, Jack.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Are you going to help me up?
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I can't stand it.
Life mocks me even in death.
What?!
What?!
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
What do you think?
Hi, David.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Thank you.
How shall I do it?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I'd like some tea, please.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Yeah - sure!
Matt?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
Why, of course.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That don't do us any good.
We can take blood from anything —  If it's comin' to us.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well, what?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
No.
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Yes, now.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
You haven't got a uniform?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Why pick on him ?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Absolutely.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
Oh, ten dollars—
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
They must have turned him down.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Where's Charlie?
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Never a good thing.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
I think I recognize you.
I could use the walk.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
She got two of them.
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Let's ride.
I got three.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
A trap.
Pass me some whisky.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Ah.
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What is it?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Died a hero.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Maybe, maybe...
You are a charmer.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
Heard of him.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
If I could go back to farming --
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Boys?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
And what's this right girl like?
Little ones.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
Mmm.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Was it worth it?
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Right here in church?
No.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
By burning down their homes?
Move you fools!
Just perfect.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
We did.
What is going on here, man?
What is that?
What, sir?
I remember you.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It's going to be a long winter.
It's going to be a long spring.
No.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
Pick me up?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Turn the light on.
Why?
You never noticed.
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
We never really shared one.
I'm just leaving.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Are you sure?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
The message you left.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
This.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Oh really? That's great.
Two at nine? Perfect.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just say no?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Forget it.
What's that?
Jean? What?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Yeah.
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
No, I guess it's okay.
No problem. 
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
So was I.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Hmmm.
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
Listen, what's your name?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
'Gonna wait outside.
I can paint anywhere.
We're not gonna let it.
I know, I know.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Milo. Why would he --
So you believe me?
Remember Lyle Barton?
...Different?
What?
Oh, right. Hold on.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're just afraid to eat it.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Is it your dish?
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Sure.
Maybe we should all get on it.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
Just do it.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Got out of my other commitment.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
She saved my life.
He's out of prison?
I don't know --
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What'd he say?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You'll come up with something.
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
What?
Uh. Not exactly.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Did you tell Alice?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
Where is he?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Hey, how are you?
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Yes?
Be careful.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
What?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
Love is... love is... love is...
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
I am not.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
Fair enough.
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.  Scott!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
What did you say?
Show me.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We don't judge here.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...
... head ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
... power ...

Secret ...
... love...
Hope...

Fear ...
... love ...
Peter ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
There, look!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
As you see.
I have an appointment.
Eh? In here!
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Any ideas?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Is there anything that isn't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Orders.
To kill me?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
It's called Black Leather.
Shall we?
What kept you?
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Still a bit chilly ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Half-brother to be precise.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Mother and Father know best.
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
This way ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Bond... James Bond.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Not interested.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
Mr. Thomerson.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Keep me informed.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Why don't you get undressed.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yeah.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
I hope those guys are all right.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
That's more like it.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Good.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Oh, no!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
About what?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
We're gonna be okay, man...
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
Who asked you?
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hey.
Yeah... too bright...
Brian, look --
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Saw what?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
How do you know?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Well, you did invite me here.
I wanted to be a good one.
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
It's a small town.
Sure you do.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Pest control.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Just wondering.
You look like... Brian.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Nice boat.
Engine 115, right?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
Cute.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Me?
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Don't bullshit me.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
What case?
I'm on it.
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Yeah, him.
I'm a revolutionary.
Why are you smiling so?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
You ain't happy about the green light?
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm out.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Manray needs a job.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
You're now Mantan.
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
This is Cheeba.
The big one.
The pleasure is mine.
A gift.
For what?
Is that good or bad?
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You sound like the media.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I'll be right over.
Yes he did.
I can't go all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Not at all?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
To come back to our roots.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
She hates dem.
...yes she did.
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You don't read, do you?
What?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Don't try to change to the subject.
That is none of your business.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I never was more in earnest.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
All Europe shall hear of this!
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I have faced that problem before.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is my only object.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
The Prince left him only that choice.
What is to be done?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes?
Yes, he's fine.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Shut up.  West's dead.
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
That'd be my reaction too --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Of course --
But not Pike's.
You wanna bet?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
The creek bed --
How do you know that?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Oh, come on --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
What don't you know?
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Where are they!
Maybe --
Maybe he...
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Does Osborne agree?
You knew Sergeant West?
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Move him.
Why?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Something like that.
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
You're off to a late start.
Not the happiest of memories?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Little bit.
They got their stories straight.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
So did I.
Nah.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No death certificates. No crime.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Want company?
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
So you took off your shirt?
He whispered it in my ear.
But you didn't see it, right?
What.
Wrong answer --
Childs.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
It's too neat.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Good luck, kid.
Not yet.
I don't expect to.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Don.
How would you describe him?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
I was dreaming.
Can I take your picture?
Well, it's not a short one.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
And I like you.
Okay.
Beats me.
You learned from the best.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
You owe me three-fifty.
Son?
Can we talk?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river?
How I go.
Okay. Okay.
You say...
The River!
Story of my life.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Hello.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's up with your father.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You know what for.
No I don't.
I paid for those guitar cases.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
We'll stop then.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
I'm asking what you're here for.
He says he feels safe here.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
And...
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
Tell me what he said.
Do you believe in love?
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
Syevodnya
Yes I know.
They go.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
Excuse me?
And. It's wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
Well what have you got?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What's your name?
Whatever.
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
When? Now? Oh. No.
I need ya help again.
Hey.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Why you got me chained?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
No ma'am.
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
The... chain helps.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Nothin'.
You can handle it.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Like I told you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Then what?
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
That's right.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
What?
Yeah, I do.
Got in a little accident.
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
The hell you call me?
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Let go...
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
The Wolf?
Saving your life.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What'd she say?
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
Hey, all right.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
If you give me one.
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
I can see that.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Good.  Very good...
You were too far behind.
Shut-up.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
A resort city, Beppu.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Luck.
Yes...
Call for help.
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
You have a helluva way of answering.
I don't think so.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Unavailable.
You could fake it.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
The cheese...
No one's keeping him here.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
I'm amused.
Dope?
He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
He'll be dealt with.
I'll pay you.
You want him dead too.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Death.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Like what?
Like...
You could help us.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Garbage man?
You didn't like her!?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
You start.
What about a summary then.
I think we're through for the night.
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
It's okay.  Forget it.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
Ya.
Prosit.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Let's hear it.
Too old.
But if you could?
Yes?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
For holes.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Come on.
Sorry.
Why should I be?
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
I think you need more help than you've got.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Where is he?
Oh.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I wish I could.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I never felt better.
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Just wait here.
Holden got hit.
Black?
Please.
The machine works.  She is.
Almost through.
Sorry.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
Pris.
I don't have one.
You scared me.
Just better.
Beautiful.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's your problem?
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Yes?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
Oh, brother...
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
And that's it?
Yes.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
I know a short-cut.
I haven't brushed yet.
Thank-Q!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
What?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Then forget it.
Yes.
What for?
It does?
Sure.
Everybody's divorced.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
I told you I've never driven before!
Is this your house?
I like it.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
In the house?
Yeah.
Do I look crazy?
I like her.
No way.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Goodnight!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Yes, Eve?
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes, sir.
Of course!
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
No. Sit down.
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Merci!
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
Yes, sir. It's true.
You nut!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
The recovery is very impressive.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
The hotel.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
Twenty-five? Around there.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
Well, we're here to help!
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Good god.
Yeah.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
I never know anymore.
Yes.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
How could you?! This is just like home!
You have tranquilizers?
What?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
What?
Hi.
Coming!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes.
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, my God...
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I think...it...works.
Always good advice.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Where?!
Stop!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
Yes.
Yes, I like you.
You don't?
Who's it, you mean.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I did. Are you?
I think I better go.
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
Baby wants to fuck.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Can I feel 'em?
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Here's to Ben.
Good, let's drink up.
This is it.
Be right down.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Let's go.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Okay, yeah, call.
He got a little jealous.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, Sandy.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Yes.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Go find one.
What did you do, Connor?
Aye.
Got it.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
You think they sold me out? No way.
I-I'll tip her.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Know any other languages?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Shut it. It's Ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
A bit.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
He's a good man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Where's my cat?
Male or female, bitch?!!
Really want to know?
The fat man.
The Sicilians.
Twist of lemon!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Y'know it is, a bit.
What the fuck do you mean?
I mean he ain't here.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Y-Yes my son.
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
He says. This is he.
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Hang on a second.
Just turn right here.
You're right. You're right.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Inez, this is --
On the left.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Would of been nice.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I'm not. But there's --
That's not correct.
I know.
Where's the rest?
$383.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
I know that. But --
Ah. Couple days ago.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Get out of the way.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Yeah.
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We're not sure.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
He stole a tractor.
No. I'm not.
How?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
What do you mean?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
Who?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
Jesus Christ! No.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
I didn't do anything.
Dies y nueve.
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
Yeah.
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
Where were you?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
That's your friend Anthony?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
You're the faggot.
Not even for emergencies?
Let's cut the bullshit.
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
That's your domain.
OK.
God DAMMIT.
Did we get it?
I don't want to talk about it.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
I don't know.
What the fuck possessed you?
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
I can't do that, Bob.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
What is it?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Yeah?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Here we go.
Now!
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is no good.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He's damn good.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
There was a mistake.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
Thanks.
Okay... 
I killed them.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
He's dead.
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
I'm sorry.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
-- it hasn't been two years --
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
We can't wait to be sure.
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
-- it's just him? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Get on it.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
I want to hear it from you.
What do you mean?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
Bourne?
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What? The tapes?
Here?
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Who's this?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Are we locked up?
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You mock us with a smile?
Hamish, I... thank...
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
I rest.
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
...Tonight!
I need you so much! I love you!
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
And I will consult with mine.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Great. I'll see you soon.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know. These things take time.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Those are your clothes, silly.
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
What do you mean?
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Because you're... different.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What's wrong with you?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yes?
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Goodnight.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
I don't know the finish yet.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Won't you join us?
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
No, Victor, no.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
-- Yes?
Yes.
You're saying this only to make me go.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Any time.
Right.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Here it is.
Yes. What is it you want?
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Goodnight.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Good day.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, Captain.
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Mademoiselle.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
The clipper to America.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Huh!
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
-- Thanks. I will.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Go ahead, Ricky.
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Uh huh.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
I don't want them here overnight.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah?
No. Not me, boss.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
No.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You are.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
So do I.
Cold.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
For when I travel?
I have to.
You want to.
Could you watch Jango?
Yes there is.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Great.  Really.
You too.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Yeah.
Mom, meet Jango.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
You fucked us over.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
You're fucking dead!
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
To Wilson.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
No sweat.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm sorry, Homer.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I doubt it. She's just an...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Candy. Candy Kendall.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Hi...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Nobody ever wants me!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
You still doin' it too fast!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Yes, for both.
I don't know it.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
You do it then.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
It's just my heart.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
That's it.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
It look nicer then home!
I told him that you all is sick.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
Ten percent. Of how much?
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
After you cut her loose.
Today? Started off great...
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Let's go, Jake?
But you won't get that splatter effect.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
That's it.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
I think two million.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Don't worry about it.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
What about what?
What about the money?
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
You sure?
I'll find the time.
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Then who's the Banker?
The King.
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
We're here.
That's it?
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
High five.
Jack Manfred.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
Maybe another time.
All men are cheats.
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Sorry.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not particularly.
And your lady?
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I. sold the car.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I want to hear it.
What job?
It came my way. 450 a week.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Probably.
What about a drink on the way home?
Why not?
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
How can anyone be that naive?
No.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
You don't like cheats, do you.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Ross.
Have I?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Over the river.
Have you got transport?
She's my baby.
I'm not going to report it.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
It was you, you shit.
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
You won't. Not without permission.
I said good call.
Ever?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Yes.
He's a good customer.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Arm yourself, bomb.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
This is fun.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Yes, Doolittle.
Yes.
Naah. All stable.
Commander Powell is dead.
Wha?
Veil nebula.
Ah, negative drop.
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Doolittle, hello?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Guess again.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
Don't look down.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
A grand.
I'll make it worth your while.
They took my daughter.
I know.
Look, I'd really like to...
Mommy, where are you?
Soon, baby.
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
I'm not a half bad cook.
Bent.
That would be appropriate, yes.
We are not fine.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
The other one like you...
You lost me.
Your basic hodge-podge.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Open it.
You don't want to.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
I think you should go now.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You know what I'm saying.
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I have sincere eyes.
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
What if he's on the level?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
But there's another side--
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Got any KISS?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Oh, screw it!
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What's in Sandusky?
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
The paint!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
NOW!
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Yeah.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah, you did!
Good morning...
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Donnie.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Donnie! Give it back!
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You know what? I think that you did it.
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
I'm going home.
Yeah?
Well...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
The whole movie. Let's go.
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Who's Frank?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Know what?
Grandma Death.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I don't own a television.
Follow him where?
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
What else do you think about during school?
Who is the boss?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
God exists because you're horny.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Where is he, Donald?
Goodbye, Donald.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
He was a year ahead of us?
Donnie? You're a dick.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh-you-beccha.
Huh?
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
We was robbed.
It's okay.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Here, have some.
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
And the year before that?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
What!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
Take a letter.
Who to?
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Take a letter...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
What's the matter with you?
All right -
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
Give me that again!
You worm!
Once more! 
You upstart!
Yes.
THEN IT'S WAR!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
That's it...
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I found it.
Did you see it?
Like this. 
I'll get my bag.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
He fell.  He falls.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Never mind that, I want my man!
I want him back!
Good morning, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
No, more of an acquaintance.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Are you comfortable here?
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Good morning.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Yyess.
My name is...
John Merrick.
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Who are they of?
The children! May I see?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
Good morning.
...Can you cure me?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Pardon me?
Who, Father?
But, Father, it IS!
WELCOME?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Then let go!
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
I will go and wake them up!
That I cannot tell you.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
He wants to kill US!
Shut up.
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
I don't know! I just did!
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
I know!
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Sorry!
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
ROW!
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
You'll be sucked down too!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
How about making friends?
What are you talking about?
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I... I...
You could charge him what you like.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Well... I... I thought...
YOU do it!
I'm drowning! Help!
Help!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I know, Dad.
I must only let the red rage...
I must KILL! Kill!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
Me too.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I told you that later.
You did? You liked me?
Hi.
Here we are.
I was not.
In the world.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Why what?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
Yeah?
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
I like to read.
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
No, I'm okay for now.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah? Oh, great!
You'll call me, right?
When?
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
You're not ready.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I want to know you.
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
What do you mean?
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Do you remember what we talked about?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
But you weren't. I could tell.
And I didn't have an argument.
Come up and see me... now.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Not yet. Not married.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Joel.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Me too. There's this poem --
Female.
It's freezing out here.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Joel, come here. Please.
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
Well, you obviously don't know me.
A bully? Moi?
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Doesn't sound like me.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
How's it going?
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
What? What do you mean?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
How was it?
Go back to sleep.
I hope you get your work done.
I'm glad you called.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
You found us okay?
What?
I don't know! I just said that!
You better go.
Hell no.
Hi.
Can I... I brought some --
Then why did you ask me?
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Then check the connections.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I'm staying with the Countess.
You don't?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Well.... er...
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Why? Why do you have to go?
I was a successful model once.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I heard it.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Justin?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Coffee.
No, thank you.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
Run!
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Nothing. It's nothing.
A power drain --
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
What's on your mind?
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Crystallized.
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
That's what we're here to find out.
Negative.
If it worked, yes.
What about it?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
It's done.
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
Better if I just show you.
What is that?
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Starck, give me a read.
We don't have time to fart.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Come again, Skipper?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
He's dead...
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
Can you shut it down?
It's cold.
I don't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
We're losing atmosphere...
Decompression wouldn't do that.
I'm trying, goddammit --
Ship's log.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
The forward airlock.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
Where do you think? With Sue.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
So are you!
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
Okay, "mom."
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Dude. That's my sister.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Reed, we're running out of time.
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Sis.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
You're fired.
Nice to meet you.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
No. It's too soon.
Really?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
Damone. It's Mark.
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
Really.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
That's me, Merv.
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
I like sex.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
My brother is gonna shit.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Should we buy a frame for that?
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I want romance.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
You're gonna flunk me?!
Aloha, Spicoli.
How about your phone number?
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
You keep them.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Do you really have to go?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Righto!
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not where we operate.
Naked.
What?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
He wanted the pineal gland.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Why what?
I have to go.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Whatever's right.
Lucy.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
They were all veterans.
No, she's looking for you.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Extract of pineal!
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
You and a lot of other people.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
Upstairs.
OPEN THE DOOR!
Hey!
No. You?
What?
Look.
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Yep.
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
What?
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Keys.
Get outta here.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
BONSAI!
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
HELLLPPP!
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Nothing, just lookin'.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I admire your strength.
I think --
I just hit it like you said.
Who's this?
Very fine bone structure.
You see: We've got to change that name.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
I'm not!
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
Oh.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
A rich actress.
In my eyes, officer.
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Without me.
Showdown.
Thank you, Harry.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
You really want to go?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
Thank you.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Fifteen.
Address?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Harry.
Well? What'd you think?
Enh.
Quietly.
Eight stories.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
What?
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
You can't drink.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Will you marry me?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Just a little way.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Who're you?
I live here.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You got it.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
Sure.
Mama...?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Normal. Average.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Sedate her.
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
I will not! Kill me now!
There, there... shhh...
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
And you look so lovely.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
The world is a dizzying place.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Not as weak as I.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Now husband and wife.
It wouldn't dare.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Oh God.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Are you a physician?
You know of it?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
My name is Frankenstein...
I will protect you.
Right! Right!
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Thanks, Alice.
You okay?
Artist.
Not if they're where I think they are.
I'll go take a look.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Wet. I don't know.
Oh, you...
Somebody'll see.
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Thanks.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
That was the telephone.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
I call it my shower dream.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Okay, Fireman.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
One night on the town.
For two lonely nights.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
I said new, this is an '90.
So let's do it.
I have no idea.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Jacob.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Come again?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
My wife.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
Auto wreck.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes.
You're a preacher?
Was? As in not anymore?
Why'd ya quit?
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Pass.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
Yep.
Kate, Scott?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Everybody goes home!
What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.
You asked me if I would --
Noooo!
Anytime.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
What dya mean?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
One... Two... Three.
-- This conversation is over.
Cops.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Or what?
I don't know, you just passed out.
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
No problem, lieutenant.
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Standing right here in my office.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
No, sir, WHAT?
Across the board, sir.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Yes, dear.
Sounds familiar.
You'll think about my offer?
'Snot me.  It's him.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What?
Well, now I feel so much better.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
You heard me.  Move on.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
North?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We are so fucked.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
O'Neil, Jordan.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Go in there. Talk to her.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
Are you sure?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
This is not the place...
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Allez, allez!
They didn't make it.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
It's the French Secret Service.
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Makes us look more American.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
...Damn you!  Damn you!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Nothing.
Yes. Good was done this .....
I played Richard III...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Nobody was WATCHING?
Yes you did.
What's  your name, son?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
What?  Up?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
There is no weather in space.
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
Never mind, Fred....
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You... know us?
Something BAD happened here.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Catch me later, okay?
But what if Sarris survives?
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
NO, Thank God he has not.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's as far as it goes!
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
The army can survive without me.
I?  You all know my history.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
What?  What are you talking about?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
We better, Congress invented him.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
You invented this, this...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
The British army, sir!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
What's the difference?
How can you say that?
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I don't want to see your hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
It is; we need you George.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Voltaire, of course...
Just because they are born?
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I guess still in the locker.
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
Calm down, Bear...
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Harry, let me answer that.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
What about her?
Get something going there.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Who is this?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
That's correct. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Sovereign.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
Not yet. I just started.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
But you work for the casino?
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
It was in the Herald.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
That's not bad.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Compass.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Sit down, Leo.
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
I just caught the end.
Not yet.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
I'm going into the movie business.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
I'm going.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Chili and me.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
Why not.
What?
Maureen?
Roger?
Yeah.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
Oh yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
What?
Get up.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
Hard to say.
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
She take a radio?
Murphy.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
What?!
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
That's what I call a payday.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
I feel fine.
Yeah. Thanks.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Only way to be.
Did you see him?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You sure it wasn't me?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
If it was a ship she hit.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
I don't know, are we?
What happened.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
I don't know.
Epps, over.
Right here.
We hit land.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
Go.
Let the buyer beware.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
Sorry.
You're up late.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Moving to Sweden.
Lost my sea legs.
A what?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Better late than never.
What's this?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
I...
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Jesus...
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi.
Can I come in?
When did I say I hated you?
Hey Josh.
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
In fact, never.
That lets us off the hook.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Let's go hassle Josh.
As always.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Everybody's too stupid!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
He does that every single day.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What? When did you see Josh?!
Why? What did he say?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
It's fine.
I dunno...
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Get a job!
Fine, and how are you?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Five hundred.
A dollar seventy-five.
Watch my stuff.
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
PLEASE? We have to!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
For nineteen years...
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Are you okay?
Never...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
YAAA!
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
So, do you like me, Seymour?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
I will if you want to.
Call me sometime.
No... they said she was here...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
I don't know... where is she, then?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Don't they, though?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Then why do it?
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
That's what the books say... 
You mean nobody died?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
We need to talk.
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
I got big. 
Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John. 
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Once... 
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Four should do it.
Hold your son high. 
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Thank you.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
I'll supervise.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Thanks.
You're really good, you know.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
You were the one who got me in.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
She's new in town.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Well don't think!
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
And decent.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Hi, Louis.
Hi, Louis.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I am Zuul.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I know.  It happened by itself.
Yeah, yeah.
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
No kiss?
You heard it?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Good guess -- but no.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Wow!
Yeah, I can smell it.
Why not?
What do you mean "bad?"
Oh, shit!
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
But it's my favorite state.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Send them out!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
I'm serious.
So am I.
He left us at dawn.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
On my honor as your daddy...
Well, they die for it!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
Quintus is overly idealistic.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
But could you try?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Yes.
With a family?
I'm glad.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
That woman --
What?
You mean the one who --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Yes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
What?
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
Let me go.
Goodbye.
What?
I don't know.
I might.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't see how we can.
You really will?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
What?
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Plastics.
Not exactly.
What are you then?
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
That's right.
No. 
Let's go.
Right.
What do you drink?
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Pardon?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes.
No.
Yes?
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I've got to go.
Yes.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Do you want to?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
Why don't you get it.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
Yes?
Yes.
What?
Benjamin.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
What?
Either one will be fine.
You're welcome.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
On your first time --
Wait a minute.
Well?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
I got up.
What?
I don't remember.
There's no risk?
Always?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Thank you.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Is it?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
What?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
At college.
Yes.
Art?
How do you think.
I don't think we were the first.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Why not?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
Of course you did.
Of course I wouldn't.
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I don't think so.
Goodnight, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Nothing else.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
What about it?
Different.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
That what he says. Right?
Not now.
No.
Why?
With the pearls --
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Have you seen it?
Oh -- work!!
Too bad.
What?
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Chasing what?
Money.
I'll do anything for you.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Yes --
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
On the train?
Bless you --
Not at all, sir. 
Oh, a Baron! 
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I did not ask your advice.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
I don't know.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
No, doctor.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Yes -- that --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You're trembling.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
You don't understand that do you?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you like me better?
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover... 
Moreover...
What?
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
It's urgent.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
I had to arrange about the trip.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
No water -- What a place!
Of course you took the initiative.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
What a session this has been.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Good morning, Madam.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Take them back, Suzette.
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Please.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Me?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
You are late. Hurry.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No. No word.
I know -- I know.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
Your what?
You expect me to buy this?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You want a drink?
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
No?
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Don't mention it.
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You're too young. You should be in school.
In your other hand.
Let's find out.
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
You ain't seen nothin.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
I don't think I need it.
That's what I say.
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Yes?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Sure. Let's get it over.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
The cemetery...
I can be real stiff.
Care to join me?
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I was trying to get away from someone.
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
I borrowed it.
Why not?
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Michael Meyers!
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Can't you?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
We can light our own tree at home.
Then they can watch.
What if it's Kara?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Here.  Let me try.
He's gone.
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
I'll meet you over there.
Why did you take Jamie?
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Let's talk about something else.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
You told me.
When?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
For Africa.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Out!  Out!
Hello.
Are you--
Life has denied me that thrill.
Is anybody besides you here now?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Oh hell.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Mom?
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Who was it?
It's Mom.
What's this?
Nothing.
Open the bolt!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Situation.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Do say hello to your mother.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Ram it up your ass!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
What then?
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
I don't think so.
Why not?
If he wants to go.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Did you like it, dear?
Just one favor.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
If he thinks he's man enough.
What a handsome word.
No.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You startled me.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello, Mother.
She's fine.  Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
She's crying because she's so happy.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You were wrong, you quack!
There's a certain amount of information there.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
You hope.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
My violin is avenged!
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
If you want to be found that way.
What is this thing that kills me?
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
No.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
There was so much going on.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
I don't want to live any more.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
Who have you been talking to?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
He can hardly talk.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
Keeps fairies away!
He is my father.
That's something I suppose.
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The what?
It's suicide!
Paul's only twelve years old.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat.  How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Goodbye.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
I just want to ask some questions.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
What do you mean?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Just one.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Huh?
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
'Sucking off.'
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
No, please go on.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
On your own land?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
So then, Mr. Mast...
You are.
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
In G.R.? Why?
What are you paying me for?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
I don't know.
I want to meet Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Who?
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
Com'on, tell me.
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You working in San Diego now?
Thanks.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
No, no. I just took it.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
What?
Yearse!
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Promise?
Maude???!
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Look.
What?
What is it?
But we can't just dig it up!
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
What is that he's working on?
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Superb.
Yes. It's almost there.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Okay.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
What is it, Harold?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Yes. They're old friends.
Yes.
Here.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
It's all right. It's organic.
For you.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To a girl. Here.
A sunflower?
Perhaps it is.
Can't complain.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. My uncle.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
Why?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Your classmates?
Your studies?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
Frank.
You knew?
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
You a doctor, too?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
Kyle, you don't have...
I've got to finish it.
It's been Hell.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
You were ALL human!
The Cenobites.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
See? I don't like that --
-- Hound of resurrection?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
No. It's not.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Me?? C'mon --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Did he, now?
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
My job.
Oh-n-no -- I --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Goodbye.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not from you.
Well good n-
Good night.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
...Polo.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Strong.
A brute.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
Yes, I --
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
My fucking hand!
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
You did this before, right?
HE did. I've seen him.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Kirsty?
You remember.
No.
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
Bastard.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
I said: don't look.
Ssh!
Hurting.
Keep your voice down.
What?
Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Just to your left.
Where's Daddy?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Just a thought --
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
In here.
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
Let me see.
I'm going to throw up.
No, you're not.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
I'm here.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
Kirsty.
I've seen worse.
No. I'll do it.
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please...
Please. I can't bear it...
It's better you see for yourself --
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
Oh?
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I won't be a moment.
Try me.
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said: I found a room.
You'd like the house.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Kirsty.
Steve?
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
He's gone.
Gone?
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
Not that late.
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
Oh no.
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
I won't let anybody take you.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Well what's the point in that?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What are you snickering about?
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Terrific.
What band?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You're not even coming?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
Yes way.  It's really...
No.  We need the gig.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
He's not worth it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
What do you mean, four more?
Is that it?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Hey Rob.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
No, that's okay.  Really.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Think about it, Rob.
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
Hi.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
What, what?
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
It's me.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You know what I mean.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
I guess I am.
Who the fuck's Pig?
What do you want to do?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
You know the difference.
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
I know.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
So?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Thank you.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
Yeah.
Good.
That way.  You?
That way.
Right.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
So so.  Up and down.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Well we don't.
Whatever.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
Dupont Circle.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
He was innocent.
You?
You are being foolish.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
A little dusty.
That's impossible.
I'd like you to try.
He is older than I.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Damn you.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
No!
Not power.  Not control.
I'm just curious.
We've got nothing to say.
Spare me the details.
I want Taupin.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
What are you doing man?
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
You're not from these parts.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
It is the truth.
Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
Me arm hurts.
It's like to kill me first.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Me father has taken back my hand.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Kiss me.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Kahn?
How did you find me?
Not so long.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
Get up.
Are you here?
Should I care?
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
For the moment.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
The check, Bruce!
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Where'd she go?
Yes!
Where are we going?
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
No, you don't!
The power of the press, huh!
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Sweeney.
Dead?
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Afraid? I should say not!
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Thanks.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
All right, Walter.
Railroad tickets.
Finished!
Was she? Did you notice?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
What is it? Here!
Who did you talk to?
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Walter, you can't do that!
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
I always have both.
I'm busy, Duffy.
They can't do that to me!
I think it is.
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
All right -- all right!
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
So long, Hildy.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
I guess so.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
Hold her, boys!
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
What do you mean -- through?
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I did.  Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
Just -- one -- second!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Throw him out, Frank.
I never saw him before!
Go on -- shoot me!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
I'll go right after it.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
That's good.
Mother!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Quiet, Mollie!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
How much do you make a week?
Who do you think!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
She and Mollie were talking.
I know.
Only till they get you into the local school.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
What's that?
Say them.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
OK. You're in.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
The sodding water table.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Naturally.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And the bride.
You joined up.
Oh, that.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's not. It's happening to me.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
How are we going to cope?
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We did the decent thing.
I wish it could all have been different.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Whoopie fucking doo.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Fucking great.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Now, what makes you think that?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
But if you did.
I don't.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Really fucking awesome.
Way out here?
You're a real fucking piece of work.
No problem.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Yeah, showtime for what?
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
It won't work.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Rise and shine.
You got to be fucking joking.
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Recover any bodies?
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
You find something, Georgie?
Yep, I found something.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You said it, not me.
Let's go see.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
I ain't got a warrant.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
I pray to God there is.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
That must be him.
We found one.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Oui.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You are sweet.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
No!
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
Very well.
Ouch. Yeah?
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
And I think I'm going to.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
Lila, I want to help you.
Nathan told my brother.
Ready!
My God! The fork! The fork!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Flares?
Absolutely.
I love you so much.
A deer?
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Good. Making progress.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Even better.
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Next game, ten bucks.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Do we need words?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
You tell me.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Sit down.
Cut.
Deal.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
You being cute?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
What's that supposed to mean?
For who?
For me.
I never saw you do anything else.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Where do I sign?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Where?
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
I said we're leavin'.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
I got time, Bert.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
You name it, we shoot it.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
You don't need a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Yeah. Just like that.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
That's right. When?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Ten dollars.
Hi.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Shoot.
Okay.
Call it.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Fifth of scotch?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Come here.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Oh, it's not bad.
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
Yeah. For a little while.
What's this supposed to mean?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Me. It's Eddie.
No. You?
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?
You need the words?
Yes, I'm glad.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
He went off someplace.
Just for luck.
I'm a little tired.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
With them?
Yes.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
My wife.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
I don't know.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
What?
Please.
That's fine.
You got that right.
Round back.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
What, Jim, what?
It was so real, Dad.
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
Is that all he said?
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
Why?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
No, but it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
The State Police.
All their lines were busy.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
David? How'd you get this number?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
Did it work?
You bet it did.
So sue me.
What's the bad news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
What're you talking about?
A countdown to what?
Checkmate.
So think already.
College nickname.
You try Martin?
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
Just getting a feel for her.
I can't shake her free.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Be careful.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
We're already over Mach 2!
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
Deploy.
Air... water... your "sun."
And before here?
Many worlds...
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
You are on your own?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All my life!
Yes. My treat.
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Arghhh! Oh!
What?
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Where did this come from?
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
Yes?
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
In that case, I permit you.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
What?
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
Mine, too.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
Where is it? I want it.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
It's important!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Right.
Well, what was left of him.
You did!!
Don't worry. He won't.
She talks in her sleep.
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Try and burn through the ropes.
And the chair.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
I'm out, Dad!
What?
Stop! Stop!
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Ships that pass in the night...
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Thanks.
It happens to me all the time.
This could be close.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Get out of there, Dad!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
A long time to wait.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
No camels!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lao She.
Step on it, Short Round!
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Behind you!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
You will go to palace there.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I know the feeling...
Maybe he likes older women.
No -- real food.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Dr. Jones?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm going down.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I want to go home...
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
Go!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
What for?
I know you did!
Who's you?
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
Why not.
It wasn't him.
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Shut up!
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
That a new Datsun?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
Why he's argumentative?
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
This is a Fiesta!
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
No. Don't tell the guards.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
Don't know.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
Nothing. You just do nothing.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
The beach?
Just get there.
What is it?
...Just beautiful.
Good Idea!
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Eat it.
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
A girl.
You're out of shape.
What's happening?
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
Don't just stand there, say something.
.
Where are you staying?
What?
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
I made it work.
What are you looking at?
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. By the window.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
You got any books in there?
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
Shit! You're in love.
You get time off to sleep.
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
Where are you going?
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
Neither can they.
You were with GRUNER!
Come on.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Not sure at all.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
While he makes the run.
And don't let her know, either.
What exactly?
I don't know.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
Don't give her your name.
Oh, I can't.
Good.
I insist.
Don't worry.
Let us get to the border!
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
Then how did you know?
**?!! 
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
We met on the beach.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
I think I've heard of you.
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
You'll feel better
I will?
What?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Yessir...very good sir.
What's what?
What?
I didn't say anything.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Blake?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
Haven't seen you around.
Do what?
Yes, of course.
I waited for you.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
Who do you work for?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
Why'd you run off?
You seemed interesting.
What do you mean?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Who did?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
How do you know you can trust me?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
Oh sure.
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Beats me.
What?
Oh.
I know the territory.
You coming along?
This going to work?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
For you.
I'll come back for you.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
We just don't stop.
Do something!
It wasn't me. It was him.
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
I know a nice island.
I don't know.
A drink...
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It is?
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
The other working.
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
What about Al...
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
For reading.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Where?
In the backyard.
Yes, baby?
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
How about you?
Oh, I love that stuff.
No, I'm not...
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
Are you sure?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Catch you later.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yes, it's on the stove...
Right now?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Thomas Sandefur...
I'm doing an interview.
Use the bathroom.
That's for food.
Who's calling?
Did you say Berman?
Yeah.
Let me call you back...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Oh, baby...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
Area code 212-555-0199.
I'll call you then.
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
No shit.
What's this?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
What?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Far as you go where?
Did work.
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Good. I want to talk to you.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
You okay?
They do this with impunity!
I'll call them, Lowell.
Yeah, great.
I don't know what to do.
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
You try and have a good time.
What?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
It acts as a drug on the body?
It acts as a...
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Excuse me?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Set one side for Bel Air.
I should be in therapy.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
I already made my move, Kenneth.
What?
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
It's about time.
I said yes.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
I'll be right back.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
How do you know?
I told you. I was hungry.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
No, that's not all.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Okay Miles.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Me. Yes.
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
No, we're not!
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I have a watch.
Fabric and fringe.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
What kind of "stuff?"
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's marriage.
Marylin?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
I fell in love Miles.
It's okay Joe.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Hello Miles.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I thought so.
Marylin.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
You used his credit card.
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Do you know him?
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Well, that's about to change big time.
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Heh heh.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
Now Rex.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What are they?
Berry spoons.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Who's Rex's guy?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
The reward.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America!
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Who is he?
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Yes. Peter Warne.
Oh, please, Dad—
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Yes, of course.
What happened to your money?
You win!
Yeah?
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
That's right. You didn't.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
You're on a budget from now on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Where is the shower?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um. You're doing all right.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
It takes money to buy food.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
What?
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
was—but—
But what!
What?
Raw?
You think it's simple, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Eat a carrot.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
What happened?
Why not?
You're forgetting you're married.
You bet I did.
Same to you.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Left twenty minutes ago.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Just your imagination.
What's 'at?
Huh?
Yes.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Don't "Joe" me.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Yeah.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Collect?
Collect.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Zeke.  Git!
Yes, Ma.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Orange, New Jersey.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
You're not digging.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Why?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
You still questioning any Cubans?
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I know.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Well... yeah.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Take a look across the street.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
And he never hit you before?
Was he there often?
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Uh huh.
Thanks.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Yes, Max, I understand.
Won't forget?
I won't forget.
You.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Hey, Jackie.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
What's she willing to give us?
What's in it?
Beauty products.
That's my diet shit.
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Can I see your I.D.?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
That doesn't sound dark.
I am, as a matter of fact.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
It was the other guy who busted me.
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
You're not old. You look great.
It's not really something I think about.
Yeah.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I don't care.
I go back to work tomorrow.
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
The day you got me out of jail?
That's my job.
More or less.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
I told him I might.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
We're partners.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
Not every day?
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Not really.
Who's the other one?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
What about you?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Gimme one anyway.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You already knew that?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I knew it.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's true, isn't it?
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
Who?
What'd you care?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Sure.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
The roller disco one.
Where were you?
Detroit.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Sure.
Yeah.
Does that bother you?
All right already.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
You sure?
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
I dunno.
That was Beaumont.
What's your relationship?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Did you get it?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Twice. In the parking lot.
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
In the chest and stomach.
What?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Pull the car over.
It's in there.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
What?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
They don't have your winning personality.
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have it with you?
Livingston, huh?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Winston found you.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
I know where it is.
You sure?
Yes.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
He leave town?
He's around.
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
No! Oh God.
It's fun.
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
Well, try, huh.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Hey, wait!
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
Don't go.
A couple of weeks, I think.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I need your insight, your intuition.
New? He's been here for years.
Jacob Singer.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Who did?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Thanks.
The room!
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Don't ask.
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Jezzie, I can't see.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
And look what I got.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
What's wrong?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
Coming here?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Here. I'll do it.
I know.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
What's gotten into you?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I promise.
Please.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
Where are they?
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where are they?
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
It's strong stuff.
Just relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
You got a nice tan, though.
Total delirium.
Help me!
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Nope.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
You in trouble?
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Everywhere, like a plague.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
On top of him?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Oh, come on!
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have time to argue!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
We made it?
What?!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
Cool.
Where'd you get the gun?
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
They're back here.
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
We could convert fission transistors.
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
And now we're all out of it.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
Where is he?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Negative.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
I guessed.
What if we don't?
Not so bad.
Oh sure, all the time.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
You'll be fine.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think so, why?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
Oh I like her a lot.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!
GO, GO, GO!
Just get us to the ship!
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
You need to get laid!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Ssh.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
See you then . . . doctor.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
What have I done?! Idiots.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
It's my charter. My party.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Feed the dogs.
I think they make you look sexy.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Just sign it, Larry.
Let's all have a drink.
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I wish it would rain...
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Some friends and me took a house.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
Let me see your hands...
Fasten the pole.
What do you see?
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
And I'll drink to yours.
The shaft is giving.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
I totally heard you did.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Oh, hey Vijay.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What is your job title, exactly?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Oh, go fly a kite.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Blood and guts.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
I know what junk is.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Uh, thanks.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Nope. We're safe.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I don't know.
What?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I went to the doctor today.
Wow! It's magical.
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yeah, like people in love.
Thundercats are go!
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
A Pilates machine?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Looks like it, yeah.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
Could I try that?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
No it is not!
Hold still.
What?
That's not true!
Early, you are so sweet.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Walter Livesy.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Vernon, Florida.
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
...Then some.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Damn right I do.
What happened to Adele?
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Up yours.
I heard that.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Look again!
I'm finished.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
No, thanks, I can manage.
Shut your mouth.
...Janitor's job.
Who are you?
His Parole Officer.
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes. Altogether.
You're clean.
You fucked it?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, that's the best.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
What for? That guys a dick.
Probably.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
He looks like my uncle.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Fifteen for me.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah.
You sure?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Of course I do.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Bang up stuff.
Here. Swallow.
Because your a virgin?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Of course I do.
Come dance.
I guess so.
Were you protected?
I'm sorry.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
It's like...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
I don't know, eight or nine.
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
Yes.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
What?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No, I need the original note.
Then what's he talking about?
You're a lying bastard!
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
Did you know her?
You'll find her.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Very good.  How did you know?
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
For what?
Who's Kathy?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
It's important.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
About a quarter to one.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I went out.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
Feel like practicing?
We'll call you back.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
It seems like such a complicated game.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead now.
It wasn't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Why?
You're not?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
I'm sure you are.
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
And you?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
I tried again and got through.
Nothing.
Exactly.  It's the key.
Where's the note?
Why?
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
No he didn't.
He didn't tell you either.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I got lucky.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
Colwyn ...
All the passages are guarded.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Of course it was.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Where the spiral begins.
She can see the Beast!
I can. Because I choose it.
You have done it?
Yes. It is today.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Even by you?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
What else is left for a man without friends.
How did you know I had sons?
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
A flicker of talent.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
Sugarballs?
No.
You can have half.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
Food for crows.
Oh, my poor stomach.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
Yes. We lost five.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
She has the power to kill.
Fewer will survive them.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
But you would not stay with me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
Why do you want to know?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Good.
130... 140...
You were scared, weren't you?
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Too heavy.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
I think.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
I have no fear.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh, that's good!
Ten dollars... A month.
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Here comes the resume.
I don't accept that.
I won't let you die.
You have?
There was no card.
What?
The new store?
We can do it together.
Why do you polish it?
Then why?
There's no reason.
I will -- I promise.
You like to take walks?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
Pacifica, California.
Yes.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Not our problem.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Making the grand total?
Perhaps there's another route?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Where?
California.
Walking where?
California.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
She never ate a slice.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You're amazing.
Saluting.
What, come on?
In a hospital.
I need your help.
Hello.
What?  Who are you?
This isn't right.
What are my choices?
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
No.
Water?
Water?
Are you working?
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I sometimes fade out.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Yes, that's right.
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Thank you. What time is it?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
Can we just forget it?
Can we just ignore it?
Thank you, Sera.
No... we already talked about that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Let's stay for a while.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I've been all right.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
It's me, Yuri.
Sera... please go.
That's right.
I can't tell you.
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
What?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Is everything okay?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
Yes, I am.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Aristotle.
How about --
I don't know.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
You know her?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Yes, you are.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Thank you. I love you, too.
Josh proposed!
No way --
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
No, she can't move for an hour.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
What do you think?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
I got bangs!
Really --
Why not?
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
So are you!
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Thank you.
See?
Are you serious?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Purely a precaution...
To finish last evening's delightful work.
What do you want with me?
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
To be my bride, of course.
What do you want from me?
Yes?
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It's terrible.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
To be sure.
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
Careful, lad.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
There's the way, mates.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Sunlight.
Hurry up!
He'll not escape me.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
If you like.
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
Or perchance...
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Be patient.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Shhh!
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
To fetch your napkin.
My own father...
Its powers are strong.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Only what's right...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, Jack...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
And I love you, my husband.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
As fair as me?
No!
I don't believe you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
And am I not fair?
Jest with me then.
How so?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
I'm promised to another!
You... you... you mortal you!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Up ahead!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
In a dream.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
I thought I might stop by.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Mom said I should.
Who are you?
Red.
Here, honey!
And why was the alarm on?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
Why?
Monday.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
What did you think it would be?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him I said "hi".
I'll get your back.
No.  That's okay.
Turn over.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
Does everything have to have a point?
What are you talking about?
I'm not gay.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
What?
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
He buys and sells the world.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe that's too long.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
She's out with a friend.
Oh...okay.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
You don't have a choice.
I almost saw Catalina.
I warned you yesterday.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
Did you got through my pants?
Sit down for a second.
Hi, Mom.
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
That's not true.
What do you know about me?
I gave up on you.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Why wouldn't she leave?
That's so weird...
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
I'd build a house.
God, you look like crap, George.
I want you to find someone for me.
It's okay.
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He doesn't answer.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
What did you do with your dog?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Where will you live?
The garage.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
I want him with me.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Well, for later then.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I think so.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
No.
Nothing.
You got the money?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
I could use the money.
A man he respects.
I'll make you something.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
You can't go because of Sam?
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
That's the problem.
Sam took them to a movie.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Take it off.
Either do you.
Hey.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
I didn't go in your room.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Dad said it first.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
He's a big one.
Not for me, it ain't.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
I'll be right back.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
He looks like he can take care of himself.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Nothing.
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Still got that ten dollars?
What ain't there?
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
Claude.
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Let me take a look at that map.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Let me see that.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Don't touch that car.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
They're touching.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Rayford!
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
She give you that scar, too?
Satchmo.
Me? Willie Long.
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Blacks welcome there?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
It's our time, brother.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
I'm calling you out, brother...
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Angels don't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
Oh. Sorry.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Beast.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
Peppermint... alright.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I was DeNiro!
All right...
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Andrew.
Really?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Good. I was concerned.
What was that?
Are you dead?
No.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
I love you.
I love you.
I don't know.
If it's Cassius, yes.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
It'll be all right...
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Well... you can't have them all.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
At Carousel tonight?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm Mary 2.
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Please... No.
No.
Well then...?
He was killed.
Later.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
And now?
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
Six. I go red next year.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Maybe you'll think of something...
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Then the answer's yes...
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Beloved wife...
Are you sure?
All this. All of it.
At least it's over...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
All right.
And all alive you say?
Yes...
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
What?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
What's that, Ed?
Me, too.
Can I call you?
It's me...
Hi.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
I used to.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice, I...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
What's up?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No.
Yes.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
He didn't come home.
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
I... I didn't say anything...
My... My head.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
Who's it from?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But...
He's got some fucked up friends.
No... of course not.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
All right!
Pornos?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
You're my man, Pete.
Who is this?
You know who it is.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
No. No, I don't.
Yeah.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Sure. Sure I do.
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Come on... get in.
I do like you, Sheila.
Yeah.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Oh, read it!
Yes.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Oh, I see.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
It certainly is.
Yes.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Yes.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Why, you look beautiful.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
How do you do?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You're startled?
Yes, charming.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No.
Then it's done.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
What is it, my son?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Hello? Colonel?
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Come on! Quick! This way.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
See that spot?
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
Well - I mean—
Chang! Chang! Chang!
All right. Sorry, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
What's she got to do with it?
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying—
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
hope you'll forgive me for—
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Why?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Please don't go.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Hesitated, sir.
The hell were you thinking?
It's not even a fucking door.
What the hell...
I guess I lost:
You got smeared.
No. just peace on Earth.
I gotta be honest about something.
What happens if I say no?
You do?
What?  I thought you just--
Yup.  Sure is.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Right.
Ha ha.  No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Gee.  You really think?
And what's this ... ?
I think that's what's happening...
What if he's telling the truth?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
I'd double it and add 20.
Right.  Oh, and here.
In case I need it.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
They respond to fear, right?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
You're not taking me in!
Did he say where?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Fine.  Good.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went right to the President.
Actually, I don't know...
Can you see?
What?
They're inside.
Agatha...
Forget that guy --
He won't.
Wait.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Someplace safe.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
She grew up.
She's still alive?
RUN!
Just some guy... they found.
Because I found out about her...
Anne Lively...
We know each other?
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
... Graveyard shift.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
The nation votes this week...
Tuck in your shirt.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
In the middle of the night?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
And who the hell is that?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
No maglev system.
The mall?
Georgetown.
Now look at him...
Sir?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
But you call this room the "temple".
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
All right, I'll try...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Tell me!
You're not gonna kill me...
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I believe in that system...
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
The safest place of all.
-- and then walk out.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Then how did he --
He also said Crow was a fake.
I'll be right there.
My God...
Not quite.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
None.  This was arranged.
Who?
Yes.
He's not here now, is he?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Yeah.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
I can take you down there.
Thank you very much, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
See you later.
So you're models?
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
He's not doing it.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
No.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
With what?
How could you let her see this?
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
But what about them?
I don't get it.
You driving her?
Yeah.
Get away from her.
Yeah?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Quick drop. In and out.
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
I didn't say that.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
What is it?
You want --
Take a few days --
Bobby.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
Depends what night.
Understand me?
Yeah.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Thanks.
What are you saying?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
It's not losing record.
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. I know the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Shhh...
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I don't know.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
To keep?
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
Well, I don't want to walk.
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
What the fuck do you...
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
You would think.
So we're working?
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
She was jonesing for me.
We're not getting whacked.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
I'm your soldier.
The penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Yeah. I want it.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
S'up.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
How much is what?
The videos.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Here...
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Soho Grand, right?
The Soho Grand?
You'll love it.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
No. What is it?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
You rode?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And where do we bring it?
What?
Tell me.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We're square.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Keeps me out of the army.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I like you, country.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Lemme write it down for you.
Why?
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
Nnnnnnn!
I'll take your goddam bet.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
The bitch was there.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
There's two guns on you.
Now.
That really you, Red?
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Don't con me.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I don't know how.
No, Brother Minister.
She ate.
There's nothing to talk about.
Just an idle question.
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I love you.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
How do you know?
The talk is everywhere!
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Down front as always.
I told you we don't know for certain.
Yes, sir, I did.
"His greatest greatness."
Say what you're saying.
And like a fool I believe it.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?!
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
And don't come back.
...That isn't a whore?
You hear me, girl?
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Fine as May wine.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Tell him about Baldy.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where?
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[The what?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[You stole the drop.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Nothing wrong.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
If they like me.
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
I'm not crying.
I go to school, don't I?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
Where?
Everywhere!
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
You need to practice.
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Don't worry. You will.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
So are you.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
What was her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Do you know what she told me last night?
I'm trying, mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
I think it's fantastic.
Hmm?
Creasy.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
What?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
I'll call her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
Where you going?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Well, it ain't your baby.
Marty.
Your son Marty?
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Please...
No...
Please...
Marty...
We just live one flight up.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Goodnight.
No, I'm not kidding.
Where you going now?
I'll see you.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You gotta good heart.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
What didn't you like about her?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Hello, Thomas.
That's all right, that's all right...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
He's parted his moorings.
How you, Radar?
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Look at that right eye.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Duke Forrest.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Be right with you.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
I can't... couldn't.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Oh, Jesus.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
How did you get called that?
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Duke...
You really say the cutest things.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
That. It's out of the act.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Yes, sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
What's that, Henry?
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Yeah, I'm all right.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Hello.
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters!
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
The letter.
What letter?
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
What bonus?
Oh.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
Look!
Both of 'em?
The heelots!
Who?
Who are they?
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
John Doe Club?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Huh? Get what?
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Did you write it—or didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but—
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
I'll take half of your action.
You don't want to know.
Is that where you're family lives?
You're gettin' the car.
Automatic.
You got it.
Is there a problem?
I what?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
What's the suspect's name?
For now that's all.
Spread it out.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
National Marksman Competition.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
It was okay.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
You living together?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
Why?
To save lives.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
We won.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
He's cutting down the visibility.
Pull up alongside.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
You worship yourself.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
You heard.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Just now.
It's very nice.
And you think he'll...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
What?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Roper...
Who's running it!
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
Yes, I believe he has --
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Okay...
To live forever.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes.
From the dream.
Then what?
So wrong --
Yes.
The new world.
It's not real.
Not real?
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
But what if he doesn't --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
At least a day.
I'm South Dakota.
The weather.
Who?
There is no --
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
What?
He wouldn't say.
Not his style.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Where?
Times Square.
Insurance?
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
Night City.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
For what?
You weren't real.
I know.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
This.  No point to it.
Just like that --
Activated.
Program name?
Describe program function.
-- Standard.

Resurrection.
Access established.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Zordon...  he's gone.
They're called squirbs.
There should be a way to open it.
WHITE TIGER!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!

Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
Did I say anything?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Tell me about it.
Not another word.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should I be?
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
No. Not everything.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
For what?
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
But there's...
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I told you twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Tommy Reina.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
They don't give a shit about us!
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Didn't know you felt that way.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
And what do you want out of this?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Come on. Be polite.
Fuck 'em.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Now that's a hard number.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<i></i> In what way?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
And you don't deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You don't like where I live?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Dating anyone?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
But I was dusting.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
He's an organic farmer.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Forty-five all total.
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
What! Who?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Diz--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Any time.
I'll cherish ya.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Right now--everything I own--!
Take me home, Diz.
He's a house-afire!
That infernal phone!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Great saints!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All right, why?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Certainly. Step right in.
I beg your pardon?
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
What? Who?
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
Mr. President!
For a question!
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
How's Amos, Ma?
We'd better see.
Office of--Senator Smith?
J-Jefferson Smith.
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
A *day*!
Tonight.
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
What?
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
And a *lot* of paper!
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Since sixteen or so.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh--*Saunders*!
But--I've done everything I--
Hurray!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
That's dynamite, Joe!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
What do you mean?
He's lost complete faith in me--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
You won't stand for it?
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Do I actually *see* this--?
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Sometimes twice.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
And sings.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
Next, please.
No.
Why not?
Are they true!
NO!!
Yes, but I—
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
He did? I play the tuba—
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I'll get my hat.
All right.
Are you? When?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Oh, hello darling.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Running away is no solution.
We're not going out tonight.
With pay!
Uh-huh.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Last night he proposed to me.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Hurry up!
Come on - let's go!
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
I wanna see that guy!
Let me go!
This is outrageous!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
You can't?
What?
That tuba player!
Yes.
How do you do.
Why, no.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
No, thank you.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We own an opera house, don't we?
Naturally.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
No, I mean - about my client.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Yes?
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I don't know.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
Is Mary home?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
No!  What do you want!!
Hmm?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
I think he's got a point.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Stop now.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Go to hell.
I didn't hear you.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
But you did come to me.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
My patient had to leave early.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
You're on your own today, honey.
...so accomplished.
Lily.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
What do you mean?
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
Something's bothering her.
No.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Which thing?
Either one.
Transference!
Transference.
Hello.
Which show was that?
You're not the only one...
But...
What is your name?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
What do you want me to see?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
How are you?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
She's probably ten years older than you.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
This --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
You don't think I'm insane?
Definitely.
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
You and Candy...?
How'd you do it?  The new you.
All new people start with that...
Psych major?
English Lit.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
And then killing your sister.
In the desert? What for?
None of the above, thank you.
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
What friend? You're my only friend.
You shall see.
Oh yes, always.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I am an English woman.
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
I would never!
Twenty.
Forty.
What are you doing here?
No?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You swear?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
If you call that a kiss.
I know my treasure.
Are you sure?
The things that get you excited.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
For entering the afterlife.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Got what?
I have no choice.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Yes?
You lied to me!
Way to go, Evy.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
You have got to be joking?
I know you knew I'd know.
And what's that?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
I'm the Bowler.
The Inscrutable Six?
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
I dunno.
Sure.
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
What about Captain Amazing?
Why bother?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
So are you!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Terrific.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Me.
Then why are you here?
Remember the cat.
You're a spy.
What?
Roy.
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Yeah.
That was easy. 
What's your real name?
Yeah.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Monica, where are you?
What are you talking about?
Bye. 
Monica!
And you are a fool.
When I am sure I am among friends.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
Are you coming or not?
With what?
Why not?
Who's chicken? 
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Wait!... Look!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
Definitely.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Be a Mohican. 
The who?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
But how do we get in?
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Right.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
And where is Joseph?
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Ajaccio.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Why didn't you wake me then?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
Junot?
When is she supposed to return?
May I offer you a drink?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them married?
I cannot promise you that.
Promises mean nothing.
You are my old friend.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
Yes.
Why did you give it to him?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I wrote it.
You wrote it.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Yes, he has.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Let me have it.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Suga!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
I'll do it.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I can't taste nothing.
You walked?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
I didn't see nothing.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait for what?
What about me?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Make sure.
Hold on.
Well bring yo' ass on...
What it smell like?
Just hold your breath.
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Peace out, Craig.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
Thanks for the help.
I got fired too.
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, Debo.
I don't know the number.
What?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Huh?
'Take your car?'
Yeah, and hurry up.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
That's my girl.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
Business or pleasure?
Business.
San Diego.
What?
Yes?
My security people are right next door.
I have a problem.
You were very nervous.
No.
Who did?
Same to you.
I'd like to know what...
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Where did you get these? Who are you?
What about the gun?
Then I have time for a drink.
Tell me why he's dead.
You fucked up.
I kill her - and you kill me.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No, please...
No, that's,..that's fine
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods.
I know you do, honey.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
No, kisses to...
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
Hi.
Thanks for the tip.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
What about them?
Right there.
You're wasting time.
Do it!
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Dad, you're bleeding...
You understand?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
And I won't never tell about the money.
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Don't!
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
All to pieces!
Tricked us!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
The money, Icey.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Ah.
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Sshhh...
John! Don't!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
Up river.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
You could save him, little bird.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
All right.
Where's the money hid.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
How's that?
I was praying.
Harry, what --
Get up.
I'm through, Harry.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Where's your Missus?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
I been out with men.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
What?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
Haven't slept, have you?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Hi.
The killer.
You do?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Okay. Hi, dad.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Right home after. See you.
Get into bed.
I will.
Great
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Put that damned thing down!
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You were screaming like crazy.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
He's nuts about you.
Yeah, nuts.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
An omelet.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
You should. I'll show you.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Positively not!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
What is it?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
The former Duchess!
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
A week?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Just looking around.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
What business?
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
No visa.
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'll try.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
That is correct.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
The telephone is ringing.
Oh, let it ring.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
This is a place for workmen.
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
I have never heard one.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
And General Savitzky.
Darling, darling... please!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Yes... a kiss... salute!
All right.
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
That bad?  Old or young?
Am I interrupting?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
Hello.
I must ask you to leave.
In that case I can only say good-by.
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Père Mathieu's.
Where is that?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
You do it.
Why me?
You think this is just about politics?
I figured that out.
He wants money.
Pay him.
I thought the gloves were off.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
... go on.
There's no secrets here, Al.
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
You never told him?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
We could leverage Helms.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
No ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I never met the man.
The White House.
You're fucking me.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Her name's Sandy ...
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
That was a long time ago.
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
I know ...
It's hard to lose ...
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that.  Us.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
I'll never run again.  I promise.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
I don't want them to love me.
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
Are you okay?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
When?
Tomorrow.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
The "crises"?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Well what would you call him.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
No.
You sure?
That's the boy.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Well. If you say so.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Well I didn't see it.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
Hey.
You know what's goin' on?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
I mean the nature of you.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
You expect him?
Screwgie.
Not a bleep.
All right...
No me mate.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't know.
You know who it is.
I don't need to talk to you.
Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
Nobody. Accounting.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
Now. We close now.
You live in that house behind the store?
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
How's that?
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
November the 28th, last year.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Yes?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The option.
You want to change rooms?
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
It's called a transponder.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Yes.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
To kill your wife.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
Are you jackin' with me?
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
What outfit.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
You should get the order you want.
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Tell him what you told me.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You must be joking.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Well, you are.
I gotta go.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
No, Del.
Yes, she is.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Uh-huh.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Los Angeles, California.
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Worse.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I was talking about what you could wear!
What? Where was he?!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I have to leave now.
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
No, that should be more than --
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
...and put them in your mouth.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Should I kill him now?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
...among others.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I'm not telling.
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
It is, if you like idiots...
He's waiting...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
No! Let me try this!
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Oh fuck...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
"A Reason to Love."
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Four hundred, Delmar.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Not that I'm aware.
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
It's just a symbol, honey -
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Not your...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Million point two.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Yes, Sir.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Nobody. It just came to me.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Well, goodbye.
How're you doing, Sarge?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
He was. He died.
Yeah.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
But in what ways?
I haven't made up my mind.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
It sure was.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
No, they're for your mom.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Sure.
No problem, but who's Susan?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Not with me.  Not with people.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
I have the gun.
Remember that.
Please...
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
She better.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
I know.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
I did.
Shit!
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
I mean it!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Huh?
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
What?
Why?
The furniture guy?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
0150.
Fuck her too.
People.  In the house.
That room!
What?!
PANIC ROOM!
What do they want?
Feel okay?
Shaky?
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
I saw something, I saw...
On it!
He WILL.
Why?
Not an option.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Look this is bull...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Alone...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
So what's the deal?
Right on Brother Judge...
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Late summer.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
It's a start.
That would be nice.
Pride will do.
You got me beat on both accounts.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
Who cared for your wounds?
As you wish.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I consider them linked.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
It's already over.
It's safer if we stay together.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes...  ... father.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
No, I don't.
And what do they know?
You don't hate him.
Thirteen years...
You said bribery twice...
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I am, I think.
What are my orders?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye, Harry.
Four, five miles.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
For what?
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Earned.
That bad?
Worse.
When?
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Yaay!
Well, I thought it was safe--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Because you promised.
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I swear.
Not at all.
What?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I don't know.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Ayuh.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Remember.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I'm sure.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Wait as long as you like.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Aye, for us there is.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Would that I could.
Boy overboard!
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
You're speaking up for him again?
That would hardly be proper.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Me!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To the Black Pearl.
Nor did you, I noticed.
She can hold a bit longer.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Only a little.
Pirate.
No.
Move!
Because you're a pirate.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Depends.
On what?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
Where did he come from?
A moment.
But --
Please.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Ain't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You're not rotting meat.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
That remains to be seen.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Then you still love me?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Poppy, this is not the time!
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
The trunk.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Yeah, I do!
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Well, you got another problem.
You're looking for a urine sample.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Who isn't?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
Really?  What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
Right.  You predicted it.
That's what I thought.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
Mouse?  What mouse?
I don't know.
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
It's still inside me?
I don't know.
Something else I want to try.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
I have to!
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
It's a miracle.
And you have him?
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Stew—
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're all right.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh, hello Mother!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Thanks, I will.
Well, I should say!
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
We were classmates.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I'm afraid.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
Sure.
Araby, my eye—!
No?
No!
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
—and those and them.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
To Old Madrid.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
Yeah?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
I have. Double-strength!
All right, Grandma—
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
Ah.
Okay.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
Sure.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks ... I love you.
I love you too.
I'm sorry ...
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
No she's not.
Yes she is.
It's alright.
I don't know.
But I really should get home.
No I'm not.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
So.
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
What's the matter?
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Real rain?
Yes I did.
The basketball team?
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Oh sure it is.
No it isn't.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No way.
YOU get lost!
What happened?
I'm not sure.
What's going to happen?
Owns the hardware store.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Can we do any better?
I don't think so.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
What do you mean?
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Out there.
What's that like?
Rain.
Real rain?
It was a prop for the school play ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
Marmalade.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Nice ... Nice ...
McGinty's.
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
... Hi.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
NOW!
Oh no? Let me show you something!
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Yeah.
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Open it.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
A miracle.
Hey.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
Well, I can't talk though --
And what was this?
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
So it's ok if I bring her.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to be your friend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
Are your pants off?
Where is she?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
You're going to work now?
Yeah.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
No. I'm sorry.
I need help.
-- you said you did.
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
They don't get opened until eight.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Yeah.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
No I didn't say that.
Yes.
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Oh that's great.
I don't know.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I don't freak out.
Thank you.
Lena?
I just wanted to make sure.
yeah.
It's so nice.
This is nice.
For work.....
That's right you travel so much.
I thought that you were anyway.
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
You can't do that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok, bye, bye.
Bye.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
What do you mean?
And your name?
Barry Egan.
What's that for?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
I'll say whatever I want --
Thank you.
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Ok. You're connected.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi, Lance.
Let's just leave it there for now.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
That's funny.
Hi.
What do you have in the house?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
Seriously.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I won't.
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
That's it.
Put him through.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Yeah.
Just tell him to call me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Yes, Abbe?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
What? What've I done?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You always do.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
THEN BUGGER ME!
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
NEVER!
I'm here.
It's a formality; truly.
His wife's?
Well...?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
No. It most certainly was not.
How is the patient faring?
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delbenè?
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Come now, darling, give it a read.
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
-- words alone are insufficient.
And I in yours.
....shame on you, truly...
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
But it's just begun --
Do as I say.
Very much.
You're just scared.
Am I?
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Sure you can, just--
He needs me here.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Randolph!
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.
There's no call for that language-
How much?
There's nothing to explain
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
The drinking.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Please be quiet.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
Uh-huh
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
You are talking to him.
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
The great Spanish bullfighter
The old man has his own way of doing things
Sorry to disappoint.
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
She was . . . innocent
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
But it's not a great syllable
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
George...
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
That's for me to decide.
Get out
Pardon?
They've all seen a rough cut
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I don't want to sit
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yeah.
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
None of your fuckin' business.
Nothing...
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Here's your glove.
Go ahead.
Whadda you care?
You wasn't with her, were you?
With her? How?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
So what?
Whatsa matter with you?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
Three more, I figure.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Can you see it?
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Now take your panties off.
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What?
Then what?
I don't know.
Why don't you just call him?
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
Sure, what else is new?
No. Open the door.
All right, just don't make any noise.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Oh. When are they expected home?
He has it. Thank you.
But his leg!
All right -- you don't believe me.
Six ayem.
Not yet.
Who left -- where?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your logic is backward.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
Who said I was getting rid of it?
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Next time, have some good news.
Gunnison?
Something wrong?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
And some man will lose his.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Huh?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
No.
Now wait a minute --
Smart? She'll be arrested!
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
I mean what I said.
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
Thank you.
Too close.
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Two minutes.
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
What?
What?
Chicken?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.
Okay.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You still want to go home, Moose?
You can't protect me.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You don't want me to go.
Sure.  Sure.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Are you going down there?
Look--just relax, will you?
Open it.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
Well maybe she better start.
In my mother's drawer.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
He has a knife.
What?
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Who's that!
It's me!
They're looking for you!--
Help me in!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We'll take it!
Come on!
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
When was that?
I'm here.
Why?
What do you think?
Come on!
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
All right, darling.
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Wash up and go home.
No.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
If he could--
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Bully for you.
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Goodbye!  See you!
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I felt like it.
See, we're very modern.
Should we explore?
Hi.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
So do you.
No!  I got to find him.
What's he like?
Hi.
What?
He hates me.
Do you think your father means that?
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Hi.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
What.
Smile.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Yes it was all you --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Beauty and fragrances.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
NICK!
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're not hearing me here --
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
I love you!
Canada.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
What?
We'll need one.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Keep 'em there for a little while.
Yeah. That's love.
You shouldn't have.
I'm glad it was me.
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
The hell I can't.
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
She says a lot of things.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What?
What's her middle name?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
I'm gonna need some money.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
'Tis the season, convict.
How'd you know my name...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
He's not Nick Mason...
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Not with you.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Hell you haven't.
What?
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hate your old man.
Good for you. Protein.
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
YOU TELL HER!
...be with her...
...for Christmas...
NICK!!!
That was my king!
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
You're hitting for MY cards!
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
They changed the layout.
Fine, now.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
How do you know all this?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
Take a seat.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
You gonna put it away?
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't believe in it.
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do.  How do I look?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Correct.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I got the diamonds.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
If we don't, he'll die.
We don't think this place is safe.
What are you gonna do about him?
Yeah, those guys too.
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
And one of 'em is sick.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Go on, there's a good boy.
His letters will keep.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
That's fine.
It's too light yet.
You don't mean that Clay.
What?
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
How's that?
A little hot.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Swimming.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care what she asked you.
I just wondered. Let's go.
Kind of sore.
You'll live.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
They went on like I told you.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Who brought you here?
Where is he?
Up the trail.
I don't know -- I don't know.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Good night, Steve.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
What do they look like?
How about California?
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Ha! Right bitch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Do I know you?
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey, I have an idea...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
Hello Ray.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Open chest!!!
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Shit!
No. Try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
I don't care. You pick.
I think so.
So, whatever happened to her?
But he'll kill her!
Oh, right.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Just wait, you'll see.
We have to destroy him.
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uh, uh.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Don't touch me!!
Let me see the files.
Are these all the subjects?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Of course. So sexy.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
My holy water.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
What happened?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
No more violence... No more violence...
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
I don't feel like rewinding it!
But, Chip...
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
COCKSUCKER! 
Are those pussy-willows?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I do, please.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Right here!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
Now, here's a babe!
How to send a bill!!
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
You could go and open the door.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
What is it?
What were you talking about?
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Goodnight, Mary.
That you love Mary.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I don't know.
You will die.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
I don't know.
But you would like to know where she is?
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.
Yes?
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Yes.
Curious.
No, I think you look... fine.
Nine years?
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
Okay, I will!!
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Impotent.
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
Like what?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Maybe you want to go.
Yes, I do.
You know?
Yes.
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you want to make one?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
When we're making love?
Sometimes. Afterward.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
On tape?
Why not?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
I don't know. Possibly.
Why not?
Because.
Mmmmm...
I ate by myself.
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
Yes.
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Well, I wonder why.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
What's wrong with that?
I just thought it might --
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Why not?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Cynthia!
What!?
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
No, but I did.
You touched him?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It does not.
Bye.
It was busy.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
Talking.
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
I just want to ask you questions.
Whichever you prefer.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Prettier than Ann?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Hi.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
You're intrigued?
In here!!
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
Right now.
Cynthia. John.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
You trust him.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
Graham.
It'll just be me.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Not for three-fifty.
How about for five hundred?
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
My keys?
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
One moment.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
You knew these people?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Do I get a kiss?
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
Down to the incinerator.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
That's the one.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Lemme clarify for you.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
NIGHT NIGHT
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
What's cookin', Bert?
Nothing.  Just...memories!
You got it!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Who trusts experts?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Everything's free there.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I know.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
F for...
Fabulous!
Fast!
F for...
Foods!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
Yeah, I'm here.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Nice.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Maybe. Recognize this?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I owe her a call anyway.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Want some?
Just a minute!
We should have driven.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
And she likes Pinot.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
What?
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
I will.  See ya!
Okay! Jesus!
What're you drinking?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
With this chick.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
That was three years ago after that first party!
Can you give me some room here?
You're an asshole.
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
Is what the money thing?
What's happening?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
What?
It's private.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Yeah.
What?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Please, Miles, please.
The plan is... you go.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Back at you.
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Good for you.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know. I love that.
Hey.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Yeah.
Okay. See you around.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
Victoria.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
Both.
Good stuff.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
You golf?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Don't touch him.
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
...Tell Graham --
I'm here.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I got him.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Ray Reddy's house.
They already know we're here.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Got it!
From what?
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
Don't do it.
Dad.
They win.
Where are we going to sleep?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What about them?
There are none.
What was the first thing?
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
No.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
They think it might happen all at once.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
The one with the shotgun.
There's nobody coming?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Have to.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
Right.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I just came out to say goodbye.
It's one thing to know it...
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
I've got a job.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
The other guy drew first.
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Who is he?
All I did was kiss the girl.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
Why come to me?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
I thought we talked about that.
Paden.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I thought you two would get along.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Good-bye.
Why isn't she with you?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
She doesn't want pity.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I can imagine.
When is she coming over?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
It was a great show, Dad...
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
For her?
Why not?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
Is she here tonight?
She can't watch herself.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
I read.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
It's a yacht.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Yes, very.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want -- ?
You're in breach.
Taller?  What?
Yes, I'd like that.
But that's Simone's part.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You know what I'm talking about.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
I didn't leave you.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
No.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You hate him?
That I'm a freak.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
What?
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
Never mind.
I don't know, Cole.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
I definitely won't.
Oh.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
Dead people?
...I don't know.
Stop it!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
It's our pleasure.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
You're standing in horseshit.
What's a "little while?"
See?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Tramp.
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Manure... is life.
"-- an AXE!"
Harvest moonshining!
I don't think so.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Not while you're driving.
What's wrong?
The audience!
Who you callin' "boy?"
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Name something.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
No. Not without you --
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Yeah.
Hell, I was game!
Shut up.
That's disrespectful.
You're pretty.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Is this fun?
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Ciao.
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Well, thanks for the lift.
That man is your father?!?
See ya, Kate.
I'm begging.
I'll do it.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
That's me.
No.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
See.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Yeah?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
They're jammed!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Yeah, guy?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'm here.
Go breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
About one to five years worth.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
How's your twenty?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Chickenshit money.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Mortal.
No.
Yeah.
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
...About what?
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Without peer?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
-- You can and you will.
...He does now...
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
A million flat.
No shit.
Yeah... Sid?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
It's gettin' done Sid.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Like a mafucka.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
No?  Who am I, then?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
How?
Why, who did you see?
Dead?
Told you what?
To who?
What is it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
I won't be making the trip.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
To calm your anxiety.
To calm my anxiety.
You didn't look very happy.
And tonight?
Better.
You go home.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
As I said, then it's God, right?
You don't know?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
No.  I love you.
Not this time.
If you're here.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
No.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I never said I didn't.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Why do you say that?
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
Not too sure about that.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Yeah, what a woman.
How did you know?
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah.  It was.
And "is"...?
But "nice".
Very nice.
Tell it like it is.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Not exactly.
Are you okay?
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
Let's do it.
I know.
... Don't explain.
"For"...?
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
So.
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You take care.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Nothing.
I'm all right.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
What shit, honey?
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Why?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
You heard me.
I watched TV.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Call a cruiser!
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
She's what?
Shooting?
Let me see.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I'm always here, Pete.
See?
Hm.  What a lump.
They'll never take me alive.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I know.  I've got one too.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Can we make it a hundred?
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
Hurry up, Flash!
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
I think I'd like that.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
I know him.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Peter-- my condolences.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
It'll shut itself off.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
How much do you know about it?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Static!
Roger.
Okay. Move on.
We'll get some more.
A little something what?
Thanks.
I'll call the whole pot.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
What some brandy?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's!
What is your number?
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
They'll shoot you, Animal!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Let me go!
Betty Grable!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No?
Where'd that come from?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
It's that song, Harry!
No. I want to draw.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Says me.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Anybody cover?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What did you say?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
What time?
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
What guy?
How many do you want? A thousand?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
HoS qorDu. 
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
Can you project its course?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Please, I insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Yes, yes, it is.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
I hadn't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
I thought you might.
Aye.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Make it so.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
There are no other ships in the system.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
What is it?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
The ship... Out of danger...?
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
But, why?
Because you wish it.  
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Understood, my lord.
Station!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They know we would die first.
Wait!... Wait...

Put him on screen!  Study him well.
How is that...?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Jim please --
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother, go back!
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I saw it -- !
There's an air-lock.
Never mind! Hurry!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Are you running away from me?
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
Oh, I believe it.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Raise the shields...
I shall avenge you --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The word is given: warp speed.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Yes.
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Uhura, patch me in --
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Who?
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Distance from Reliant...
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Stop engines.
Battle stations.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
By the book...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
My name?
You play games with me and you're through
I'm wery sorry, but --
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
You've already been that. C'mon.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
What's what?
I'm all ears.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
In progress, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
Yes?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
They did, Admiral.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Mercy Hospital.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Put them on screen!
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Right on. You fly?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
For someone so young.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I am better.
I don't.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For what purpose?
Why not...?
No... I want to stay with you...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
I believe it is safe, sir.
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Eject the core.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Say the greeting again...
Wine, women and song.
Was I doing something to your neck?
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh?
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
At least four hours.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No.
I believe so.
Do it.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Great name. French?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
I have to...
No. It's a lot further than that.
Why?
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
Fire!
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Just a little queasy...
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Commander... we have a problem.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
That's the question -
I wish I knew. Uhura?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Retire.
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
How can I trust --
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes...
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
Shields up. Battle stations.
Shields up, Captain --?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
It IS possible.
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You hear that?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
LET THEM DIE.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
What peace conference?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Not yet... Section 4236...
WE SURRENDER.
Who else?
An omission. After that -
An error.
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
Confirmed, Captain!
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Yes, please continue.
I am in a room with lights.
I know.
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
To happy endings.
To new worlds...
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Fire!
Yes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
And I you.
I know how he thinks.
This isn't about me anymore.
Understood.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
Number One.  You have the bridge.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
On screen.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
Counselor?
Away team. Transporter room four.
We can only hope so.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
In time.
Why am I here?
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Not so long.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
You heard me.
And?
I don't want to scare them away.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
I'll take that.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
I make maps.
Make any money?
No.
He's got a gun!!
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Shermin...
I just retired.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
This is George Fox...
Watch it. They're coming out.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
What.
Ah no.
What.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Good.
That way.
Flashlight.
Pancakes.
X...
Money.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Smile.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
No gas.
Yes. Very good.
I am...
Closed.
I know.
My... husband.
I am husband?
Shit?
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
Yes.
Candy.
A drink.
I...
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
Horses.
Music.
You didn't even see it.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
No... The closest...
Why?
But I speak English.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes?
What?
I was afraid.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes.
It's bad.
He will.
Are you my friend?
Why?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
Yes. Sing some more.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Horses.
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
I must go.
Goodbye.
Hey buddy... let her go...
Slow down, slow down.
I don't know where he is.
Get Fox.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
We're ready.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
It could have been anything.
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Judy, that's stupid.
We can't let you do that.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
A star is born.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Make me forget it, baby.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
No.  Mace is in this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Step into my office.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
But this is a bad one.
No.  Bad idea.
I intend to.
Jesus!
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What else you got?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
Your existence.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Define illegal.
Fumitsu.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
She still loves me.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Wants to share.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
And what about the guy that was following me?
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Uh unh.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah.  We did.
Yeah.  See you there.
Right.  That explains it.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Take the tape to the cops.
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
The diner?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Who knows.
You tell me.
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Not bad, huh?
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Smarter than us.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
MyDick.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I'm hesitant to...
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Five months. I love it.
That information's being withheld from the media.
You want to have dinner?
What's that?
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
It's a no-no.
I know.
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Not the way I can.
I just need to go a little slow.
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Sit back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Follow me.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
The same.
I talked to him.
You've been through worse.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
No. Stop, come on.
Shut up.
I'm sorry?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
You too?
Yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
What what? What advantages?
Anything.
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
I'm a comedian.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I understand.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Listen. I had a great time.
Yeah. And an actor.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
What'd you get?
An eight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
There's the rub.
No. Just O.J.
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
Make someone bleed.
Damned if I know...
Rejected?
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas!
Vegas.
Whu?
She smiled baby.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
She smiled, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I don't think so.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
I'm telling you!
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
That was different.
How?
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
Minnie Pearl.
That doesn't matter.
What a surprise.
We're not messing with you...
Tomorrow?
No...
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...How novel.
...It's on.
Now?
No.
What was cold about it?
You think?
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
Be smart about it.
You don't have to wait three days...
Good.  He never doubted you.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Shut up.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
OK, but be careful.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Sure.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
This morning.
Barzini.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You wanted me to be your son.
Good.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Shhhhh.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mike, why am I out?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
You really want to know?
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Please say it.
When will I see you again?
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Tell me!
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
I can arrange security.
You're unlucky.
I think so.  Detective squad?
What are you doing in Mongi?
You just woke up!
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Say again?
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
He's downstairs.
What are you talking about?
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So cool.
How?
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Dickie?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
My fiancée.
Sure.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, when did you get here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
To the manner born.
He's having an early night.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I can explain.
It's all true.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Excuse me?
Right.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hello Meredith.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Hmm. C'e questa... 
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
We'll be there.
He says so many fiancées.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
I'll fix some drinks.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
...Tom is a mystery...
Yes?
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
I got money.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Yes, mam.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Thank you, Travis.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
It keeps ya busy.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Keep it.
Can I call you?
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
This is gotta be a game, right?
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
Just follow me.
No, I'm serious, really...
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Pittsburgh.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
I sure hate to go alone...
Got your license?
Yes.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Why do you ask?
Sure.
Anything you say, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
O.K., cowboy.
I'm here to see Iris.
Hey Wizard.
Yeah?
Things got ya down?
Real down.
It happens.
I know.
You want to talk about it?
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Tell me what you really do.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Wrong.
What, vou?
It's about time.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Partners.
You knew?  All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Hi.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
I am, too.
Whatever happens.
Delly?  In here.
That always used to work.
Dad... 
It's possible.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
I do?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Why me?
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Whoa.
Nothing.  
I'm  fine.  Really.  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
And... what's my name again?
Nine and-a-half years...
Oh.  What... what time is it?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
... Ernie.
Yes?
Yes.
Ha!
... what?
The film broke...
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Call me... Ishmael?
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Thirty a month.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Why not?
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Why not?
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
Thanks.
They will.  They w-w-will.
It's about me.
Oh.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Yes.  Very.
Got any money?
Who?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Yes?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Yes?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
If you have some, I'd...
I suspected as much.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Then go.
Look.
Just listen to them!
Take them.
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Shhh. Shhhhh.
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Morning.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
I see. How do I get down there?
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
I need her exact name, you see.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
Maybe we ought to leave.
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, my God, look at her!
I mean. I want to...
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
If they are?
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I don't mind, really.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Did you close the door?
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
He's not home.
Lovebirds, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Only violators and practical jokers.
Yes?
We... we went to school together. College.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes, I was lying.
What did it say?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
Yes.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'll get it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, no...
...everything I know.
We've got to get Cathy.
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
Almost two a.m.
How about you?
Mitch...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I haven't finished my drink.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
Of course I will.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I'm cold as ice.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Where can I find him?
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
Well? And are you not a good student?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Well --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Why don't you do it then?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
I know --
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Any attacks of pain since?
Three years.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
Dream on.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Yeah. I sure will.
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
The scar.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I was talking about you.
How do you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
No! Why are you haunting me?
Shut up.
You know.
Could say that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
I mean Lauren.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Please. Come inside.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
I'll say goodnight again.
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You still haven't answered my question.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Looks real to me.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Jittery is the word.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, my dear.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
May I walk out with you?
What time is it?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
No. That's all finished.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Would you like to sell it?
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
He's my brother.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Zero.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
With him?
Yeah.
I will, David!
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Hit the lights again.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I thought we were goin' into town.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
No.  Just you.
I like Michael.
For what.
For everything.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
Okay.
Mom... please.
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Must be a circuit breaker.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
Hi, Thorn.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Because I love you...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Nanook...
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
I don't know who to trust.
What?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Was dark... find a light...
You lying bastard...
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Well, go on.
Probably the next meal.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
Garry's missing!
You been made, MacReady.
Then I'll have to kill you.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Then we'll never make it.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
I guess I'm the only one.
Thank you.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Well, get to it.
A day or so ago... I guess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Little over two hours.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
We going to make it?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
He's dead.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
What for?
Who else could have used that key?
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Well, let's get down there.
Hear what?
The journey is part of my work.
I had an accident.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
How have you survived so long?
Excuse me?
Send him away.
It frightens you.
Oh, shut up.
Yes.
This way.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Alexander.
We make them see what we wish.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Because...
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
Darling.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
I've seen it.
Let them.
God, and I'm running late --
Nothing.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Then why are you here?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
Good night, Alex.
His home.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
He's gone to a better place.
What makes you say that?
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
All of you?
Every night.
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
I don't understand.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Orion's belt...
Yes.
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Mara...?
No!
Do you have it?!
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
I took a different route.
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We don't know.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We are what we are.
What's it like where you come from?
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
They're inside --
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
You may have known my father, William Starks.
They should just be looking harder.
Good.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Just do it.
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
[Beat, lost] No.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
To the hospital.
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I'm doing fine.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
I never knew my father. Did you?
[Beat] I don't know.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
The future doesn't look different?
Because I don't have time.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
Yeah.
You have nothing to fear, William.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Don't you go to jail for that?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
Where are you going?
Sure.
I don't think so.
Why "of course"?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
You like it?
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
You remember it?
What?!
Go fuck yourself.
Yes, baby?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Aw, God.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Oh, great.
My Lord.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
A regular outlaw.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Christ, sure... yes!
Call me back.
What?
Who is it?
It's me.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Front.
I'll call you right back.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
It means shut up, Thelma.
Why are you actin' like this?
I think better when I drive.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
She thinks he's a pig.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
What happened?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Litterbug.
Yeah.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Whaddo we do?
Gosh.  It sure is.
We should have just ignored him.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
Sorry!
Hit it.
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
What'd I say again?
Yes, Thelma?
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
We've gone insane.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
What?!
Way up ahead!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
All this for us?
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
We're fine!  How are you?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
I don't know.
Why not?
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
What?
Well think about it.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I don't know what to say.
Mints?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Out getting coffee.
Mary.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Big time.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Yep.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
I already know it, Mary.
Are you... an architect?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
How about -- ?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Well, I'll see ya.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
Well, I know you're busy...
You don't buy what?
You can't be serious.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Surprised?
Answer the question, shitball.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
Oh. Well I am.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Twenty-two.
Trying to be.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
Go!
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
You got what stuck?
I think a little of both.
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
So what's up?
Eh.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
Something your father would've come up with.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Kenny. It's over.
Cuba.
Time is of the essence.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Dean Rusk!
No you weren't.
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
Damn right I'm scared.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Don't get too attached.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
James Looks Twice?
Who are you?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Tell him, Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Good.
How'd you know?
Cooch. You're my hero.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
No way, Cooch.
Watch out!
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He said he doesn't know.
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What?
That's right. Turn around.
Go ahead, Ray.
Never mind.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
And on to a bigger one with you?
I saw one.
Where were you?
On his six.
Two miles.
Two meters.
You know. The finger.
What would?
It is combat. Every second counts.
Evan... or Maverick.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
What plane.
I'm different.
Anything.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're horrible
Where?
You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
I'm still second best.
You ever fly an F-14? 
. Yeah!
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
I want it back.
Yesterday.
Hardly ever.
I sit. I think. I play games.
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
And that's one!
Your watch.
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
Well what?
Right on the flight line?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
YEAH, COUGAR?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Saving them some paperwork.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do I want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Got you here.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
This is Maverick.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
What now?
He won again.
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
But you continued to fight.
So have I.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
The wings..
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
All right.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
I called your house.
My wife's house.
I don't know...
He was by the book, all the way.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
You got the job.
The Last Resort.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
I think my grampa might be here.
I'd advise you to hurry.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
But I thought...
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
You better get down here.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Sleazy...and demure.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Not since you lost him.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Where?
There!  The woman!
Arrest that woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
I don't know.
C'mon!
Oh, Rekall.
Well don't.
Harry!
Let me buy you a drink.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened.  You got it.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Mmmm.....
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Nobody.
I don't know.
Tell me!
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Do what?
Move to Mars.
All right, forget about it.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
--I got a trip to Mars.
They did!  But I killed them!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
It's time you found out.
I'm here at Rekall.
Nice to meet you.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
Let me go!
I love you.
What are you talking about?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
You two-faced-bastard.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
The reactor.
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
It's just up ahead.
What?
...Who are you?
Ready as we'll ever be.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
I think I scared it!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
You're really leaving, huh?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Do not talk to the driver.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
A man who plans ahead.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Little sons of bitches.
I'm gonna help you.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Not yet, not yet...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
God, what a stink!
Okay, ten dollars.
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
I know about Esparza.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
So noted.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
Oh really?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
What other case?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
Roger Baron.
-- What?
...What do you mean?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
What's Art Esparza?
I followed her from the courthouse.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
It hasn't been that long.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
Figures.
Exactly what happened then?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
It's okay, Eddie.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Don Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
-- in a context.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
-- Roger --
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What is your rank within La Compania?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Yep, it sure is.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
ALBERT?
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
No.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It's late, Sam.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
Yes, he is like a clown.
The usual, 9:15.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
No, I want to smoke.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
Laura, I am your friend.
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
Cause I like it.
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I did? I didn't see anything.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
I already made you two tapes.
Let's go all the way.
This afternoon?
I can't tonight.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
See what?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.
What?
Good night, sweetheart.
School?
...school's fine...
Dad...
A friend from school.
A special friend?
Yes.
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Who am I?
I don't know.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes. It would be.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
How old are you?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Objection.
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
We just...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
And you wrote that...
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Why?
I'm sorry...?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Four. You're great with these kids.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
Ready, your Honor.
Exception!
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
I... do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No... no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Mr. Alito, please.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked?
Yes. Yes, I have.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
What difference can that make...? All right...
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Hey, how about that!
Come on out!  We're friends!
There's nobody left around here now.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
What's he like?
Like...ah...
It's gone now.
Where are we?
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
No.  I thought you had them.
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Welcome to California!
He's very excited about it.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Chase. Hi...
What?  What kind of episode?
Like Freddy.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Your bed?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home, that's right.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
A story?
I'm fine.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
You got it.  What's happening?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
The car's no there yet?
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Me too.
Not yet.
Yep.
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
We were idealists.
Claiming their place in the world.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Thank you.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
To take a piss.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
Anonymous.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
What's the difference?
I guess.
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
I'm pissin' fire man.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Good.
Ya know... "It".
How do you know?  They might.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
My dad.
It works?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Sir...?
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Yes.  I do.
A padlock.
She's Cuban.
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
Outer.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
It hurts too much to care.
About anything.
But, they don't speak English.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
What?
Sorry won't cut it.
I don't know...
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Y'all take American Express?
How old are you?
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No.
You an indian?
Ready for another?
Why not?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
What's the name of it?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
No sir...
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Come here.
In many capacities.
Hasta siempre.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
See ya downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Why, honey?
Peanut...
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
What's that, honey?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
What's that, peanut?
You certain?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
You do.
Who knows, baby?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
We'll find out in a hurry.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
One bad car accident...
You think she's gonna make it?
Fan works.
Now what?
Yeah?
The only one.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
SAILOR!!!!
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
That's not why I called.
Santos... It isn't.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Where?
In the head.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Someone's gonna see us.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
So I hear.
You're welcome.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
You're stoned.
Isn't she?
I just mean...
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
He finished it Winter Break.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Where would we go?
Shit.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Competence.
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
The hood jumper?
Call it a hunch.
He was never able to reproduce them.
No. But I don't think that matters.
I peeked.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
You did.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
And your wife left you.
Is that in my chart?
Her dog, yes.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
No! What gave you that idea?
It's not bad.
A little.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
Really?
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I had to. Didn't I?
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
What's he saying?
I put you on the floor.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
That's right. That one.
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
No thanks.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
When?
When nobody's looking.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Yes, James.
I think so... What about you?
Just checking.
James'll know about George Sanders.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
But where? I need the street.
No, it's not that, it's...
Chancellor.
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
She's left before...
Hm.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
And the jacket?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
Dozens. It's very sad.
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
Sure it is.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Yes?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
No, the dog.
Just kidding.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
Huh?
Then what? What?!
The birthday party.
Ah, come on.
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Nothing.
I mean... feelings.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
I can't.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
I have friends.
Cop.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why don't you just tell me?
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Yes.
I don't know.
What?
The girl.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
Yes.
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
No you're not.
How come?
Yes?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
How do you know?
Yes?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Ev-i-dence.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
Do you think you're crazy?
Is that what you are angry about?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
How do they know?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I know --
You don't know!
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Sorry.
I said I was sorry.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
What?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed too.
But roughly, how old?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
I was six years old!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm talking about you.
Yeah, you.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
I like the noise.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
You're damaged.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
You're still here.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
Hi.
Because I like you.
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
How many girls did you molest?
It's not what you think.
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
You don't really --
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
You really believe that?
And what do you tell yourself now?
Bullshit.
I know.
The percentages --
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
Not ever?
Not ever.
I'm not scared.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what I meant.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Prove it.
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
No way that could just be seawater.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Hey, you okay?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Calm down, Bud.
We've only got one suit.
Tell me later.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Yuh?
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Check this out.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
He's hallucinating badly.
This one is gorgeous.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Have you decided?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why haven't they left each other?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
What! Get married?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Why?
No reason why...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I'm too sleepy.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
It was futile. We went all over.
Do you consider that a compliment?
It means being without money.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
No, not like this one.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Unfortunately, no.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
They didn't seem too good.
Lady Patrizia!
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
Why?
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Who?
Everyone.
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Who?
Oh, I know he does.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
What do you mean?
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
Do you have any children?
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
What?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Is that what she said?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Everything... I don't have children.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
I'm always bad.
I breathed!
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
Yes?
Oh, yes.
And then...
What?
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Why?
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Why?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Someone's following me.
Who?
What else?
A crucifix.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
I have to throw up...
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
What did she mean?
Why?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
What?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
You got to be crazy.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Yes.
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And you weren't shocked?
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Oh, some time in January.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
What sheets?
About what?
Your niece!
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Do you know what she did to her?
Oh, dear God.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
I'd like yours too.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Bullshit yourself!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
And what has that to do with it?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'd love one.
Pipe!
Right...
Become?  One is born a saint.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Don't be ridiculous.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Why would I lie?
Hasn't she had enough?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Too late for what?
The scandal...
No!
Then she's a liar.
Wasn't it!
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Are you now?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
They'll be here.
Well!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Yeah, grotesque.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
Sorry.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
How'd you guess?
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
See you.
Of course.
Parading's better!
Parading?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
Hello.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Foreign devil ...
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
We were going to do it.
Sit down, the lot of you.
I would though.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Hi, our lot!
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Hello.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
Is it? Is it really?
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
You've lost him.
No, we're not!
Don't start. Look.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Nerves.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I feel like shit...
Yeah, it's you all right.
Or something will be able to see us.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Take a look.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
A voice transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
Right.  Talk to you.
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
It grows on you.
That way.
Dead!
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Is it alive?
Here, let me try.
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Careful, don't get under it!
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Yes.
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
We're not going anywhere.
I think it's fizzled out.
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
You lead.
How far?
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
We're going into the freezers now.
Maybe we could write it together.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Up one kilometer, Jay.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
I'll get you out of there.
Kill me...
Yeah...
Is it dead?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Yep...
What's happening?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Do it.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
What?
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
How?
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Uh-huh.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Real man' drink.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
You have to...
No!
'Bout five minutes.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Eddie what?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
It wasn't meant to be.
Just like it.
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd and I.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Yes, you did. You still do.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
Where?
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Huh?
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
I get a party, don't I?
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
It won't play.
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I thought you were going to be late-
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
Gone.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I mix what I like.
Don't calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
What would you like? Texas?
A married lady.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Every day.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
From what would I be running?
You're quite a girl.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
No thanks, Birdie.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Why not?
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
What for?
What report? To whom?
You rest. I'll get it...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
My husband...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Karen.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
You won't forget it?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't intend to be.
Oh, but there is-
I'm not crying.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Over my dead body...
Thank you, Karen.
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I won't be a minute.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I wouldn't like.
The heave-ho.
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
Isn't that what they always say?
With tears.
In a minute...
Eve?
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Up in the room.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't be evasive.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
That's right, but I don't understand-
Go ahead, please...
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
A couple of weeks.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
I promise.
That's my Max.
Answer my question!
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--no way--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hmm.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
About the past year.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
Anything you've got.
And I'm a Republican.
'68.
Nixon.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--I know, I know--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
Haldeman.
What's the matter?
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
Night.
Oh.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
That's right.
Mind if I try?
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--what about you?--
It's right under that pile.
Just let me get a match.
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
I will not talk about the other two.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
My non-denial denial.
I don't know titles.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
OK.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
James McCord.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
Are you sure?
No.
But it's possible.
It is.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--well, Sloan--
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Suck me...beautiful?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Uh-huh.
What are we gonna hear?
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Neither will I.
You don't like it?
Because I want to.
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
What?
You want onions?
I'm not playing.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
You called me Oz.
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
Of course.
Do you love her?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
You think she was serious?
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Went home to shit.
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
I told you.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So do I, Kev.
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
I thought so.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Yes, slowly.
Um...okay...
Oh no.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
Just a second!
You want to do it?
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Me too.
I love you.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
You've just inherited The Bible.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I don't care.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
But you better hurry.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What?
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Are you okay?
What?! He told you? When?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What?!
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Yes sir.
He says -
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
I'm fine.
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
Now just get off the train.
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
It's not you - it's the dress!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Don't be
I'll never let go!
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
How do you know?
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
He's her?
Look!
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Ah! Let us begin!
It worked in Odessa...
Are you feeling all right?
Run, Anya -  go...
Remove him at once.
I should go
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
I did no such thing!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
You don't want my autograph.
What?
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
All right. All right. All right.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh - you're an actress.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Well, where is it? I-
Okay, that's good.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll see yuh.
No, I got time.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Neat, yeah.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
think that's, uh-
it's my first time.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah?
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Okay?
Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
H'm?
Yeah.
Yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
No.
H'm?
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
U-huh.
Yeah.
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Will it change my life?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What... huh?
Check it out.
Nothing at all?
I'm cool.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
Tsch, a few.
Are you?
Yeah.
I mean that as a compliment.
It's a narrow view.
Yes.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Mean?
Stop calling me Max.
You'll total the whole car.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
And... uh-
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
But she's colored.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Yes, I do.
You think so? Do you really?
We're going to take them to the airport.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
I don't know how to make her funny.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
It's not going to come up.
Really.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
Fuck you.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
She's in ICU.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Forget it, Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
He's directing now.
They're paying him scale.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
Happy anniversary.
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Truce.
Well he can't have gone far.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!!!!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
I know.
I don't want to go tonight.
You don't have to.
Okay.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Sure.
I'll do it.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
Ah there's our snookums now.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
Sally did all this herself?
And Ryan works at home.
I will treasure this.
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
That's a lot of those.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
Trust him.
Well...wow...
Not good.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
No, no thanks.
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
The Shostakovich.
Really??
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She's all over him, are you blind?
You see, that's worse.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
No.  Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
Rose.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I'll be right out.
Relax.  You've done enough.
Ah.
Like Joe.
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
I don't have a drug problem.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
I'm Princess Bala.
Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Wait, I hear something!
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Mom!
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
Yeah.  How much?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Under the mat? 
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
It's a bet.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Good night.
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
You shouldn't.
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I am. Let me get the cards.
You don't have to entertain me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
Was he really upset when you told him?
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Gin.
I just want some fresh air.
I would.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Here.
In the knee?
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
I mean, after that?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Yes, sir.
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
How would you like to go tonight?
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
What does he mean, accident?
Who else?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
What do you want?
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Kubelik.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
I took sleeping pills.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
We talked about a lot of things.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
I love you -- remember?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
I said I like all of them.
What !
No -- absolutely not --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Sure, thanks.
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
Let's talk about you.
Yeah.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yes, sir --
Call me what, sir?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
Cook school -- that did it.
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That we're dumber than we look.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
God knows.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
We're Americans.
While you were sleeping.
What is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Looks pretty shallow.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Anyone got a cigarette.
Ours.
Touchy.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Charlie?
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What do you mean?
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
What's the furthest you been in?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Don't you agree?
What about this point here?
Who?
I'm Kurtz.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
How's yours?
I can handle it.
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I was on threshold of great things.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
No -- leave it --
That's me.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
His name is...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
The river is beautiful.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Anyone got a card?
What?
Needs patching.
94   CONTINUED:  
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
She's dead.
Oh.
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
It's exactly what you meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Wait a second.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
I'm right behind you.
Forget it.  It would take days.
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
Where's my ELT?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.

Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
They'll have to come right past us.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I want us to go out.
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
Spencer.
Okay.
Spence.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Oh, please...
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Why did yo do this for me?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Two days.
I can't. I work.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Is there another way to see it?
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Welcome.
Can we order first?
It's one idea...
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
Good night.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What the heck do you mean?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Thanks for looking after him.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
About a dog.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Thank you for walking him.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Never a break. Never.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Does it matter?
What are you talking about?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
What is this?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
What?  What's okay?
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
That's right.
Bain!
You're too late.
Do you want Rath or not?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
I don't believe you.
Know what?
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
Paid in full.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
No.  Just Electra.
Why?
Better than playing with yourself.
He was killed.
Why?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
How old were you?
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Yes.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Good.
Where is it?
Mexico.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
Why not?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
In Costa Blanca.
Yes.
Really?
Sorry.
The beach?  It was nice.
Cheap as shit.
Then, we wait.
What?
Yes.
Yes.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes.  Here I am again.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Nobody ever sees me.
No?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Am I attractive?
Why?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
She was taken.
Did you --
I'm not normal.
Martin.
What?
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Yes.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Do you believe that?
Anytime.
I hope not.
Shit... oh well.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
You mean quit?
I have all day.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
What did the beer cost?
An alternative literary venue!
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
We could make a run for it?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Thought of everything haven't you.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Have you ever stolen anything?
No, for the Asylum.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Both, see you later.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
What are you on about?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Huh?
Now you're using that word.
Good, what's his number?
Some deal you did there!
Here!
You're sure?
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah, pretty well.
That one?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Turn around quick!
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Here's the details.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
Not this time, Kat.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Yo, dobree!
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Insurance!
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Yeah, but it was okay.
How did he look?
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
And you broke into that room?
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
No!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
You may use my office.
Working....Under cover.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Go to hell!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
I'm sorry about how we --
Kelly wouldn't do that.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
No. I won't be long.
Were you with Jamie?
I meant he's a doctor.
I didn't know either.
He wants to talk to you.
I'm just wondering --
York Ave.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
I don't make small talk --
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
Why?
No. Not like you.
Kinda. Yeah.
Go for it.
Know so.
Do you think I'm strange?
That is my telescope.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for something -- someone.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In ten words or less?
You don't believe in anything?
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
You don't miss a thing.
That would be the reason.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Healthy as can be.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
That sounds like horseshit.
It's not.
Prove it.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
What?
You.
I wanted this to be a date.
No.
We're doing something -- ?
Fun.
Where?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Twice a year.
Where?
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
Where? Why?
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
Anything you want.
Nothing.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I have expectations, too.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes. You?
Yes.
She did. It was you.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
You don't. That's the point.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
Are you?
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Uh, hi....
But he does! Don't you see?
How are you?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Okay, then!
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
...To be traveled through
Then where the hell is he?
So what? We'd be rich!
You know me?
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor, be serious, would you?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Curious... Very curious....
You did what?!?
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
Not bad.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
He never bit me.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
They're okay.
Tom...
I mean it.
Yeah.
What're you doing?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
You love him?
I don't know.
Nah, I got me a job.
Yeah.
There you go.
Quit my job.
Great.
Bring it along.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
How bad off is he?
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
How's he doing?
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Positive?
Yes.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
I just don't want to go.
Yes?
This your place?
Yes.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Vanished. Thin air.
First thing I did.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
What is it, Tommy?
Where's the professor?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now!
What? How do you know that?
To get my guns.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
It's kinda hard this way.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
John Whorfin will kill us!
You look!  It's not here!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
I didn't drop 'em.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
No!  Ditto the professor-
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What. What don't I understand?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Who is this?
Chet!
Chet! From downstairs!
Garland, it's me.
A week, eight, nine days –
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
It's still a little early for me.
I need help, Audrey.
...Huh? No, I'm –
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little–
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Charlie. How are you.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Ready... wrestle!
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Lou.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Huh?
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
Nine days – Tuesday –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Would that be good enough for ya?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
All of which he's now missin'.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
A couple days ago.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
No?
Thank you.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What else is new?
I thought you quit.
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Nilsen.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
It won't last.
I loved him.  I hurt.
Thanks.
No.  Come in.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Do you?
Why not?
Ice?
Please.
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
It's not the same thing, is it?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
Why take the risk?
Fine.  How's your back?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
Make love to me.
No?
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
Did you?  What's she doing?
Liar.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
He was murdered.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope, can't say that I do.
That's him.
He had a girlfriend?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
She misses me.
Hallelujah.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
Somethin', though.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
If she's telling  you the truth.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
We bring her in for questioning.
I'm sure.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
On what basis?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I don't know.
When's your show?
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
The whole thing – painting.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
What's wrong?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
Annina Nosei.
Who?
Aren't they?
You should talk to him about this.
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I need a dealer.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah.
Very well.
Out?
– In this corner?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Willie Mays.
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
What's wrong with me?
You're your own baby.
What's that?
Pretty much the same.
Forget it.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.
Stand still.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
I don't eat junk food.
What time is it?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I can't. After the show.
Yeah.
I need this?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
No, actually I feel worse.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
What're you really after?
Have we?
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm tempted.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
And the truth frightened her?
Sure.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Dad!  Save yourself!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Too late for what, dear child?
The boys need help.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
What exactly are you doing?
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Just the beast.
She knows who we are.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
But he's never said a word-
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Where is my wife?
I find that unlikely.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
I think they're getting worse.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
...Afraid.
What?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Four seconds from...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
We'll talk some other -
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
Banzai.
Just ones this beautiful.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
What?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
You do know. Try.
Excuse me.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
...You gonna kill me?
What say we flip for it?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Never heard of a double-cross?
Here. Get a good seat.
Everything.
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
WHICH CAR?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
... Where are you taking me?
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
... We could try that.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
What now?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT??
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
That's it.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Not what?
He's not crazy.
You okay?
I said I'd check with you.
Tom Jones?
Hi.....  Roses.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Meaning?
About Charles...
No, I'm fine.
Annie, it's me.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
What?  What?
What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
I beg your pardon?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
And a car.
Mmmmm...
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
I vote for Bart.
Yes?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Why thank you sir.

Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
You'll be rich!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
I am sitting.
What?
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
What's she doing here?
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Then it should be here.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Really.  I don't know.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
You're the dead.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Are you a spirit too?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've got to help them.
... I will.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
He's your cousin.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Viridian?  What is...?
Maybe Charles does.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
Their wedding clothes.
But not for long...
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, Robert. I will.
No, Robert.
In a day or two, yes.
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Our greenhouse.
Yes, so do we.
Hello, Eve.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
And I'm Ben.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
I never needed money.
Good day, Sally.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Yes sir - elevator!
... Good evening, Louise.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
That's good... That's good.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
Look, Johanna...
I said good night!
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
I'm afraid so.
You take care too, Bobby.
John Makel...
Malkovich!
I never played a jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
I'm a puppeteer.
I... puppeteer.
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The iguana.
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
We'll talk about it in the car.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
I'm a puppeteer.
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
Yes?
Yex?
I said "yes."
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
I'm right?
Who told you?
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
It better be.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I've fallen in love.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Hello. Wendy.
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Why are you being like this?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
You bastard!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
I love you, Lotte.
One hour.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
No.
Who needs dancing?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'd love to see your work.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
Was a time I knew what was.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
and she is mine...
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Baby, don't be like that.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
You on your way home?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
I don't. I have my own.
Yes sir
What you want?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
No, let her rest.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Morning, ma'am.
Go upstairs I said!!
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama?
You sure?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
Her who?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
She was only-
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Paul D.
Yeah. Look bad?
No, You looking good.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yes sir.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Oh, man, don't say that..
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
ANTI-SEMITE!
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
That fucking bitch!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
What's that, Walter?
Where's your car, Dude?
They were Nazis, Dude?
Am I wrong?
Well--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Uh-huh.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
No, they--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Your rug was in the car.
Separate incidents?
Mm.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Thank you.
You mean coitus?
No it's fine, really, uh--
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
So Dieter has the money?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Huh?
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Not exactly a lightweight.
Look, man, did you--
Is this your homework, Larry?
Shit yeah!
You know this!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Come on, Walter!.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha. . . Donny--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Who is this?
Okay, listen--
Right, Dude.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
Well we--I don't--
Well. . . yeah.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
Survival.
The House of Pain.
What about Nomak?
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I don't think so.
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I don't understand.
Not good.
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thought you were dead.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You experimented on your own, son?
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
You should've killed her, then.
Don't even start, old man.
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
I'm sorry, I --
You're joking --
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
He didn't. Get over it.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
--which she may have--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Nick!!
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--I'm not staying here!
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--a six week bun in the oven--
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
So whoever built this--
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
<u>Yes</u>.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
--fine, later, fine.
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Get your goddamn--
Just now?
No.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Then I'm going--
Whatever you want.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I do.
No fucking.
No.
--coming out of the water--
What?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Still don't see it--
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Yeah. Me too.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
What?
The wheel.
--about the Witch--
--a Wiccan--
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
--now there.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--oh, Jesus--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
I can't!
Ah, Domini?
What?
Not planning on sleeping at all.
--and we brought it back with us!
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
He'll never know.
Elly Kedward?
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
I know, I know--
Sure. I'm sorry.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
You're needed here--keep watching--
--fuck Anna!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
Well I do...
What was that?
Your husband.
See a guy.
What?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
...You ever get tired?
Marty.
What do you want to know?
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
Going out with Meurice.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
Sign.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
What do you mean...
I didn't say that.  Well?
What do you think?
Ya catch any fish?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Nah, I trust ya.
I don't know, didn't he call?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
What.
This.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
The criminals are winning.
It's blue. blue velvet.
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?

Baby wants to fuck.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

If you want to.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
I . I don't know.
What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.

Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.

Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Please. please stay.
Hello.

Frank is coming?
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.

I asked first.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

My secret lover.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?

On a ride.
Here's to Ben.
Good, let's drink up.

Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?

Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Let's go.

Okay. yeah, call.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, Sandy.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Jeffrey?. Why?
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
It's good to see you.
... You look beautiful.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
... Sandy?.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Be right down.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Yeah.  I am.
Yeah.  I am.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
You're a fucking amateur!
Excuse me?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
That was out of line.
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Allo?
Diego?  It's George.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
What?
I did not.
Cocaine?  How much?
In how long?  A week?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I'm going to California.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Good.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
I meant every word of it.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Hello.
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Better than you.
How are you doing?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
California.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
I swear.  On my life.
I swear on your life.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
They're over at the booth.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
That's right.
Don't be such a pussy.
Exactly.
It depends on you.
Second name.
Sail.
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Sure ...
Here?
I think it'll be a success ...
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
A name?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
Cause?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What did they argue about?
Your witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You get his statement?
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
For about one year.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
Why not?
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
I was angry.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
High school?
Then -- those are not your own words?
We dated for about a month last year.
How?
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
He video taped you.
That bastard!
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No further questions.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
How?
I know.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi, Frank.
It's okay.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I love you too, Dad.
-- But it's Sunday.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
You better.  Please answer the question.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Why don't you talk to him now?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
We have to talk.
Talk to me.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
It didn't get there from me.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
No. You can have them.
Lawyer here?
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
Oh, yes.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
That's it.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh! You caught me.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
Not at all.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
Why?
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
I think so.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
You get used to it.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
What?
Francesca?
What?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I would love to come for dinner.
Yeah. See you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh, how is he?
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
Yes.
How about Bari?
I sat outside and had coffee.
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
Yes, thanks.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I can't sleep.
It's only four days.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
Apparently just before her death.
You people really don't like dogs.
Hell no!
Yeah?
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Bones.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
I said, no thanks.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Where we'll always be...
Hush, baby.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
How did you get in here?
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
I have to finish this for class.
Please.  It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Your father.  He was your father.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Dad?
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
It was just like in my head.
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
What we have to do is call the police.
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
All right!  Where's the key?
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
You murdered Gino!
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Oh, right.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
What?  How about a drink?
Sure.
Where is it?
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Yeah, that's it.
Where in the hell is he?
Leave your phone on the hook.
How do I know you are cops?
You did the right thing.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
Basically.
So am I.
Nothing.
I'm not afraid of anything.
What the fuck was it?
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
Good.
...  shit.
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Shit!  Oh shit!
If he does ...
Why?
Thank you.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
...  Me neither.
I think everything is okay.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
...it's a problem...
...they won't let you go...
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
Jason Bourne is dead.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Get the kids out!
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
Yeah, I know...
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes, I'm here...
You are a friend of his?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
I want to go home.
For twenty thousand dollars.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
Yes.
Not really.
So get the hell out of here.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
He run away often?
I'm sorry.
xxxxxx
What's that?
I tried.
-- he accessed the account --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I told you.  You need to rest.
Thank you.
I fixed it myself.
...elephoned sir.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... ere please.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
You must save the day.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Jack!
Remember how they used to stick out?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Are you officer 412/L?
What?
What is it?
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
Very smart.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
So what are you going to do about her?
They weren't at school with us.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Shut up!
What?
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Good!
Please!
Oh, sorry.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
Where are you taking me?
A heavy Christmas present.
Really.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
What?
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Will you please turn back.
Turn!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
Please, Jill ... I love you.
No you're not!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
You've been promoted.
The refund for Tuttle!
Next of kin!
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
This isn't rare!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that? 
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
I don't know which numero.
Central Services.
Have you got one or haven't you?
What is it?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
No. Wait here.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
We are virgins.
He looks like a cop.
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
Just take it easy.
No!
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
IB Bangin.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
I know him. That's Noel.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
Sleeping.
He's better.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
What's that, Frank?
Backup?
It's coming.
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I've taken that into consideration.
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Do it!
Frank!
What?
You're burned out.
Faster!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You really think so?
You sure?
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You've made my dreams silly.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
No?
I'll put her on.
They booted me out of Washington.
I don't think so.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Why do you say that?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Did you shoot their boots?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Not because you have to.
Good.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Yeah --
So I quit.
Move away from me.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Yes.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
He said something about...
Let me hear it!
Right there, Bobbie.
How do I get out of here?
Yes.  That's right.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Why so glum?
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
I was a lot earlier.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Excited.
Yeah?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'll be the judge of that.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
No.  Were you going to you?
We can go together.
Me!
Great.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Where are you?
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
Good night??!
Go ahead -- what?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Uh-huh.
Are you nervous, Walter?
I already told you I'm not.
I'll pose any way you want.
Anything new?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
He made a cat.
Righto.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Here here...
There there...
Sorry...
All about me...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Are you ready?
Bye!
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
Is it?  I've forgotten.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Didn't you hear him?
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Got carried away, huh?
Enough already about it - get to work!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
Yeah and what would I say?
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, hi.
Yeah I did.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Turn around!
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Good morning Walter!
Your work, the layers of irony.
T-turned on?
Then let me give you something then...
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
Shut up!  You let him have it!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Litter, yeah!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Let's move out!
Yes!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Amazing!
We hate you guys!
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I mean it.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
Yeah?
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
I am so sure.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Pretty shallow of you.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Like my homework.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Am I in trouble or something?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Cramps?
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Same one.
Oh.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Five.
How can you keep doing this?
I'm curious, is all.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Good enough!
I was just scared is all.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
Thank you very much.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Later for it.
Hi.
My parents have money...
Swear to God.
I don't understand.
Could be.
Good.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
Okay, let's go.
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
What is she...
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please.
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Nice much.
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
My right nostril?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
A little better.
Get over here.
No.
How 'bout a back rub?
You can't seduce me.
I know what it is.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
What'd he say?
it's okay..
Oh--won't YOU come in?
I won't be needing these anymore.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn.  C'mon--
Yep.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
You got me all confused.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
No.
I heard already.
What?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
You need a nickname.
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
If you believe in Voodoo.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Don't think.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
How?
I told him.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
Forget it.
You too...Meat.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
I ain't hitting a man first.
Hit me in the chest with this...
See ya at the yard, Meat.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
...and one helluva guy.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
Hello, Senator.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
I'm serious. No interference.
The worst was Blue.
Congratulations.
All right, take care.
Hello.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Help, Daddy!
I don't know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
How did Nicky collect?
Somethin', huh?
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
Hey.
You should say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Yeah.
...to me.
She came to talk to me...
That's right, yeah.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Yeah.
She was afraid to call you.
Sammy.
It's me.
Nick?
How'd you know I was here?
I'll be right there.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You bet.
Seven o'clock?
Seven o'clock.
And they were usually right.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
Half - I'm comin' down. 
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...position...
No. Just stop everything.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
See you, Ginger.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
But mostly...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying. 
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
You can't make me stop caring...
No, you don't.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
Yeah.
And...
All right...
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I wouldn't do that...
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you threaten me!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
If she calms down...
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
So, you're a righty?
Ye-yeah.
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Yeah, thanks.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
And here. Here.
Hey!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Here we go!
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Is that what you did?
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He tries to do everything...
Is that the last one?
Great!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
And I mean... that's no good.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Fine.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
All right?
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Nothin'.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
It's what you want?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
But I saw something...
What's the matter?
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Yes.
Yes.
Come on! 
Okay?
Yeah.
I am.
Do you know that?
Here.
He called you right here.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
I think that's it.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Two?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Hey, Shelly. 
Pleasure.
But he never talked.
They're havin' a good time too.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No, no, no, no!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I'm positive.
You're a little confused?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Oh, sorry -
I'm sorry.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Then do it the way you want.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
I'm sure.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
"Well done," Cactus.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
I know.
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
Spear.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Enough.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What did--?
You turned around!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Uh-huh..
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Thanks.
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
You could've killed us.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
That's your "rep."
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
And what're you whispering for?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I don't want to know --
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up!  Do it!
What makes you say that?
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Shit!
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
Hey drop it, okay?
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I can hear you again, clearly.
She's gone --
What bank?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Don't say that.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
What did you do?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
L.A.P.D.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
What's that supposed to me?
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Naturally.
That's how it's going to be.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You mustn't hang up.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
We don't see you.
I still don't see you.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Don't worry.
Better reassure him.
Call me "Nels."
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Where do I turn?
How do you know?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Mind if I have a look?
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Doesn't everybody?
I thought so.
Yeah.
So who's he?
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Ask him yourself.
Hi.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
Did I?
You fucking did.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, Dave.
It's a simple question.
Off his wages.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
Who?
No.
Not English.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Must be.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
You want one?
Jesus.
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Like you're concerned.
A real gentleman...
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
No...
Where?
Sorry, darling.
Apologies, my sweet.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Nothing's wise.
So I'm sorry.
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Sorry.
You can always pretend.
I'm working on it.
Stop it, Jimmy.
A little.
Sorry.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Delirious.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You following me?
What's her?
You could say that.
I'm not sure.
No. Sit down.
It's a secret.
You promise?
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
No! I'm going home...
Yes.
Prescription. For my condition.
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
What?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
It was you...
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
I like you, Dil --
Love me.
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
Meet Col --
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Need to go across the water.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
I know.
You're never out, Fergus.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Perfect.
Yes?
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
It's your decision.
I told him.
Are you all there?
What?
Would make me feel better about it.
I'm sure.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Yeah.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
Only joking.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Kill me.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
She's not my type.
No.
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
The fastest.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
Give us a break.
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Don't think that way.
I don't know her.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
How can I?
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
What?
Hurling --
You don't know me, do you?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
Whatever you say, Jude...
It was fun while it lasted.
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
No, we are.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
I think that's what you ordered.
Oh!
It's lovely.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Open up.
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Yes, you told me.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be an idiot!
I'm through listening to you!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
Thanks very much.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
That's not Carson Dyle.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Very good.
Next, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's the idea.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
Said what?
Cutting it out.
I think I love you, Alex --
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
Hm?
I'm scared.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Why don't you shut up!
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Why bother him?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
I'm very cold.
Swiss.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
You mean you and me?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
What was what?
Where?
How about once more around the park?
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
That's all.
I believe what he said.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Because I don't love him.
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
He's allergic to him.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Who invited you?
Not my imports.
I get the imports.
Good.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
You said that two weeks ago.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
You are upset.
I'm not.
Are you sure?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Run!
She just turned off her light.
Did you warn her?
This will relax her.
I can.
What are you doing here?
I'm sure you should have failed.
You know about that too?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Mark Shale.
Why?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
FINE. Are you?
I won't.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Follow me.
You heard about that?
Why?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
What?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Yeah. Who is she?
The library. I'll be fine.
What?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
Are you Jody?
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's an only child.
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
Hi Sandy.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
That wasn't me ...
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!

They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!




Who drove the ice cream...

Hello.
You.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's bullshit.
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
Ooh.
That's right.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.

It's for you.
Listen, shithead!
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.


I did what I could for you...

Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
I'd say we're about even.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
I think I gave it to her.
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
Honest?
Too bad?
Yes, his girlfriend.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
What about her?
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
With her mother.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
I'll throw that in too.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
I said okay, Jake.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Thank you...

The apple core?
How are you, Lou?
Yeah, they are.
I get by.
Who?
Or her name?
No.
Didn't you call?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Yes.
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
...Just a minute...
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Where you were when your husband died.
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
That your maiden name?
No reason.
I don't believe you.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
Know him?
Get in the car.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
Your eye.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
And I want to know where.
I saw him.
You didn't tell me.
What about?
Upstairs. Why?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
She's my sister and my daughter!
I have to go home and get my things.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
I'm all right.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Ida Sessions.
Of course.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
I don't understand.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
What about the water?
When it comes.
That's a long fall.
So how are you, Morty?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
Water and Power?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
He's not in, Mr.?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He was expecting you?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned it.
They were partners.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
We'll talk about that later.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Somebody stole it.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Where is he?
That's all there is.
Two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I'll write it myself.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Who else did you see?
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Bernstein.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
We've got a nice plant here.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.

They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Charlie, please don't -
Hmm!
No.  They've passed on.
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
A rooster?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir -
Can't say, sir.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
A wasted day.
Yes?
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
What's wrong, Brad?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Was he in love?
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Yes, sir.
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I had a toothache.
What do you mean?
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
You think I'm shitting you...
This? How long have you been smoking?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
Exactly.
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Awww. That was so cute.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
Dante. You've got a customer.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
There's more, isn't there?
You don't have anything to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
You mean, on a date?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I left like an hour ago.
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
I'll assess all I want!
I can whip your ass.
Yes.
What's your point?
Yeah.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I think it's safe to say yes.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
She's in here?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
All of them.
Why not?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
What?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
You've got a customer.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Then where're we gonna play?
Exactly. They drank it all.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
No, I'm serious.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
I can't close the store.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
You know.
What, your dick?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
I like to expand my horizons.
Five hundred dollars.
You're bullshitting.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
I'm not.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Shut the fuck up!
Leave her out of this.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
It's not like I'm miles away.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
Yes.
Just the paper.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
To you?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You calling me a liar?
I'm trying.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Really?
I was kidding.
How do you figure?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many what?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
How many?
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Fuck you.
It stings a little.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
What's this?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
You hope what feels good?
Screw you!
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Dental School.
Twenty bucks.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
How yo doin', Gabe!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I copy.
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
We'll never know, will we?
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
One...
Nice and easy...
Six...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
Just hangin' out.
We spent a night there one night...
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
What if he can't?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Excuse me?
It was great.
You attacked me.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Breathtaking.
Up ahead.
Get it!
What?
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Now you get burned.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
It looks like a winding route.
There.  You blind?
You're looking at him.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
There, what's that place?
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
Good morning, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
No, my health doesn't allow it.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Yes. They want to help.
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
How do you do, sir?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Fine, fine.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
Murder, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. I'm glad
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Prison custody?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
But not now?
Just had one.
Dozen times a day.
Max...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Sorry?
Wouldn't dream of it.
I never bought that.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
Vincent...
Of course!
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
Who the hell is this?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Why not?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
It's not me.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
I tried it.
I think so.
So?
How long, you figure?
Yes.
Play music.
How can you kill him like that?
Believe it.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
No you don't.
What?
Collateral damage.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
Jazz.  Music.
I listen to classical.
No.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
You go every night?
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
Don't start.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Doesn't cover everything.
Why?
No.
Paid sick leave?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Yeah, that.
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
As in...? 
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
You turned up a one way street!
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Just drop me off.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not for years.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Switch the charts.
What?
Love.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You saved my life.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Yeah.
This would be it?
Never heard of him.
Getting rid of my hub!
Who are you, Jerry?
How is it possible?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Not this again.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
You will?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Thanks.
Not today.
Come on.
Did you kill my father?
I don't understand.
Then tell me what happened.
Because he believed me.
You do?
I'm sorry.
Without a love of my own.
Where are you?
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
That's great.  Good for you.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Excuse me?
You've asked me that one three times.
And what did I say?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
You do recognize it then?
I don't understand.
Night after that?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Agent Lowry?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
No doubt.
Ellie...
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
Good luck, David.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
No primer.
How can that be?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
This is how you see the sky?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's a civilian facility.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
The librarian... or the library...?
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Peter Valerian.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Peter.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Like it.  Almost there.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Yes.  Very much.
Prove it.
I don't think so.
The final countdown.
Oh.  I brought you something.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
What are you so afraid of?
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
What is it?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
But I made this arrangement --
Cut that backsass!
Buck is a deal.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
That's good: he earned it.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
You don't know!
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
You jes' watch us!
Pair'a nines.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Get away!
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Only kidding!
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
But </u>alive</u>!
The same as the first time...
He told me he had done two others just like it.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She don't want it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Oh, I think you will.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
That's no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
Go and look for a note.
I know, baby.  I know.
Who prescribes the brandy?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Just horseshit luck.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Tell it to your shrink.
My promise.
Yessir.
Helen Hudson...
Because I think I'm wrong.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
Thank you.
What!? They brought the car here?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Have you seen his penis?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
One of my suitors.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I can drive.
Yes.
You could get your wish at any moment.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Patient.
What?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
There's nothing to tell.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
What about the engagement party?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Truly.
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
It's good exercise, Mom.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
There's a spider in my room.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Who do you think you are?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
I've already checked it out 17 times.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
The left one.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Good God.
A small price.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
A rose is a rose.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
What's my rap?
What are the delusions like?
I wish I could have seen that.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Home free.
Not a one.
So, it's over?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Open up.    I want to see.
You like it?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It's sex time.
Shhhh.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You got wine. That's great.
I think I should go home.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Bingo.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
What?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
And all the plans we have.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What do you want to do?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
Can you loan me a 20?
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
Especially now.
So, what do you say, Let?
So will you?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'll float you.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Marcel?
Oui.
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Why are you here?
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And the other half?
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Where are you from?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
We'll think of something.
I think he's already figured that out.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
You're sure?
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Has to be.
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
Does it really matter what I say?
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
It's me.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Okay boss.
Great fuckin' song.
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I'm the driver.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
We both know I'm already dead.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Yeah, I can see that.
It's my idea.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
What?
Glenmorangie.
You wanna tell him?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
You got it in a bar?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
The lucky ones.
No.
Stick around and find out.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A car.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
Tell me, who is your master?
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're a sword fighter too?
How so?
I'm bored.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
Kneel!
Never!
Jen!
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
It is trouble for me.
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No, not yet...
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
She needs direction... and training.
Save your strength.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
What does it say?
But the sword could be in his compound.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Who ever made that.
I'm buying.
No onions?
They make you fart.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
It can't rain all the time.
It's just the dope, don't worry
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Mom tried to cook.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Take the dope, too.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Another jolly nickname?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Miss her?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Is he inside?
Move in, guys.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Annette Harrison.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
You heard me.
You what?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
On my mother's life.
Why not?
No.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Refreshing.
You implied it.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
No thank you.
Give it up.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
How was your date?
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
You're not gonna start that again.
Need any company?
What?
Lighten up.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
Why can't we be together?
Where are you going?
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
The football stud?
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
It was nothing.
Eyes closed.
I don't know.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
It's Kathryn.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I don't know.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I was just kidding.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Some other time, Cecile.
Is it me?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
Yummy.
Would you please leave.
Honey, is something wrong?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Who is this?
Where is she?!
Ronald?
Yeah?
It's Kathryn.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
Call me later.
Okay.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Excuse me?
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
And I don't.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I've never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
What about her?
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I did?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
At the old house with the voice.
Do you know the people?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
It's early yet.
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
What?
It's your play.
Well, you know where it is.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Certain wishes do.
It's true.
It was just a voice.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
She's there whenever I call her!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Don't cry, Amy.
But she's dead!
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
A lady threw it to me.
Soon as I finish.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Yes, yes -
Good night...Barbara...
She pleaded so to do it
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Can we get some service here?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Yeah but they looked cool...
I've been working out.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
No it's mom.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
Anything's better than Mark.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And my bra finally fits again.
I wonder if he's married.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
What the hell is the tampon test?
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Ignore it.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I think I already have.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
Starving.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You don't have to pee.
Since when do you care?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right... You better go.
This really isn't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Take your shower.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
What's that supposed to mean?
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Thanks.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Oh my god, what happened?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
You can't believe this bullshit.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
His wife.
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Just like that?
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Sorry, sir.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Wrong?  Look at this!
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Iím sorry...
Shut-up.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
Why are they after you?
Don't know much, do you?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What is that door?
Which one?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Wait, this isn't fair...
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
Shut up!
Please...
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
Right.
What?
No more than the usual.
You're kidding?
Don't worry about it.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
What the hell is this ?
Great.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Check his kids.
Clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well -- take care.
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
In the car.
I see what you mean.
What?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
What?
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Alan...
She knows.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Fertility beads.
Ah.
What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Oh.
Of course.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
No... They don't kid.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
The Vice-President...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I'm outta here.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
You made their funding disappear!
You weren't in the state legislature.
You1re leaving, too?
Truman used it all the time.
Thanks.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Yeah... It could be fun.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Fabulous.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
The tunnel.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
What?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
You are dying, too.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
I don't think they're in school.
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
It will?  How do you figure?
But why?
So?
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I couldn't stop myself.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
I'm in.
It's Nuwanda.
What happened?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
It's better than doing nothing.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
It does?  What?
You know,
Stop what?
Chet...
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
What is that?
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A barbaric yawp.
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it?
The god of the cave.
My brother went here.
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
I don't want to read.
Found what?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet.  I have to think.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
I will be with thee straight.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And where is our point of arrival?
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
Then you better start swimming.
Shut up!
I told you...
That's where my boat's moored.
It ain't any better out there!
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
What are you people talking about?
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
I'm not rich people.
Thank you, I work at it...
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
The quiet...
A meat locker.
You should talk...
Yeah...
And what if I run into one of those things?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
You ain't giving the orders here!
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
I'm stuck...
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Plans don't change...
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
I'm looking...
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Fucking women, man...
I know...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
What?
Get the boots.

John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.

Couple of weeks... Listen --

Tell him, Vince.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Where? Where is he?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
But you must come in.
I have to go.
You are frightened, no?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
Too bad.
Now he's back.
Inside, Vince.
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
Linda, what's the matter?
Would you?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
I don't know.
C'mon. I've got the car.
Playing?
And then you...
Who the hell knows!
No. No, no.
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
That way it sets.
You do?
Yeah.
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
Hell no!
Well, where's he from?
Yeah.
You got it.
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I'm doing that too.
What do you mean?
Three bullets -- minimum.
No way. No fucking way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
No!!!?
No.
That's it. No. No way.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Here. Behind you.
Aw, it's a long story!
That's who.
No!
Never one.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up ribbon!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
I'd think about it.
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Out of the room.
And I want Doucet.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
How do I look?
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Go in the house.
Ooops, I forgot.
But Sergeant...
Technothugs.
How do you know?
Some things never change.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
You treat her nice.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
And you should be with your family.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
Hi.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Thank you, Belle --
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
It hasn't opened yet?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
No! No! I won't.
Howdy, Hank.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle --
-- in gold.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
How much?
Coming.
Yep.
We can still use my butter money.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Worried!
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
I'm serious.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
It shows on your face.
I don't know, Jabez.
Mary! Come back ...
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
All right, son -- if it helps.
I dunno.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You can talk to me ...
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, you divorced of what?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
No, sir.
John.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
Who are you, then?
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Put it down now.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Uh, what do I call you?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
You don't want to know.
I still feel like shit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Ooohh....
I'm really shakey.
Yeah.  So how are you?
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
You don't have a choice?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Are they on the phone still?
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
You frisk me.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
The girl hostages.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Don't fuck with me ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
I want to talk to him.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Give me the keys...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
They look like good kids.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
No you don't.
I don't think so.
Yeah?
What now, Sonny?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
I'm glad it's okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
Hey.  It's raining.
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
Let's go, Sonny.
Get 'em in the vault!
How'd that happen?
What?
I want him to think that.
But do you mean it?
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?
Alive.
All right ... send them the guard.
All right ... let's go.
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
All right. 
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay, when do I get them?
I want to talk to Leon.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
What can he do, he's clean...
Gimme the black guy...
You follow my car. 
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
Open this up!
I forgot she's in here.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
What'll you do?  Come out.
Robbing a bank.
<i>$300,000.</i>

Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
What do you think, dumbshit?

You really think so?
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
We don't know nuthin' else.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Don't start on me today.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Actually we have something for you.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Heddo Jeth-ica.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Coming.
Okay, what?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
You're it.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The principal.
Wow.
The second R is silent.
Oh, of course.
Go fish.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
They can't be real.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Wanna bet?
Who's your partner?
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You're always your harshest critic.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Captain Rob came back?
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A blimp.
A turd.
Who?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
You certainly did.
I know I did.
Sorry, no further questions.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Roger that, Wilco.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Damn! What are the odds?
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
Hey, where'd you go?
I know.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Oh I think you do.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Oh, go on.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Looks like the best man won.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Can you believe it?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey can be on top?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Yes you are. 
And I you.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Wow, you are smart.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
It's a surprise.
Just like the President.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Piter.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
With your permission...
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Sire!
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not sorry enough.
They said you were dead.  They said...
Let him stand free!
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Excellent!
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Yes...
Always.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
I'd know the difference.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
I didn't feel well...
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Mmph?  Where am I?
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Eddie, how was I?
No problem.  I know it by heart...
If you say so.
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
Sound!
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I don't understand.
We'll do our best.
No!  A horror movie star!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
This is my way of telling you --
Oh, just like in the script!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Does she have room for me?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Hruphh...?
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Yes?
Oh, of course!
Tor!
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Yes?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I got married last night.
Oh.  My condolences.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Okay?
STOP!
Bela died.
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
My chiropractor!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Huh?!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
Al!
What?!
Okay, I'm nuts.
You know what would be great?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yes?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Al!
We're falling behind.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
He made a mistake.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
He says --
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Mom?
What's the matter?!
St. Joseph's.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Shari, Ray feels --
She wouldn't tell me.
Our foibles, our foibles!
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
Welcome to work, Ed.
So?
Yeah.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
Go!
I missed you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
What?
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Really? 
Ed?
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Come on...
Where were you?
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Yeah?!
Yeah.
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the girl!
Yeah.
Look, we gotta talk.
Ray, come an--
Who's Shari?
Who's --
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
The pirate ship.
What?... Why?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Good?
Mm.
Ed?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
pierde.
He likes it.
Do it!
All right.  I'll be back
Yeah?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Tracy.
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Here they are.
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
I hope so
You will.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Exactly when?
Which door?
I have proof.
More this way.
points at the motel.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
If you say so.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
I'm not like you.
What?
Sorry.
I mean at you.
For what?
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
What do you mean?
Hell, good luck!
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Don't you fucking knock?
What'd I do?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
What's it to you?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah.  But not for long.
In the morning.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
You've got it, Wendell.
I got to write my report first.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
She told you?
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
What about him?
I'm not asking you.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Against your code?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
More or less.
Nothing.
Just show me where they are!
Say what and so what.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
What does that have to do --
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
So be it.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
That's right.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Give me a minute, will ya?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Not good enough.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
None.  Call it a hunch.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Sid, how are they hanging?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
What's wrong, Trash?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Something like that.
It'll be our secret.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
Oh Jesus.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Clear as day.
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Be careful, Danny.
I don't know who he is.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
I'll pay you.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
I told you no calls.
None of your business.
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What if <u>what</u>?
No.
Who?
Not particularly, no.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
That's fine.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
What size?
Pardon?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
For that matter, I think you will too.
<u>What's</u> your point.
The robbery.
A police report.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
Listen to him.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Sorry.
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
Leave this house.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Good.
Stacy--
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
Oh Christ.
It's over.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
Why the hell would I--
It's not?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
Not that much.
Brill.
Never.
Yes.
So you've said.
Other than me.
Why would I--
Eat your fish.
I gotta go.
For the last four years.
Rachel--
I'm gonna fix it.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
What makes you think it's you?
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.
You're Brill.
Brill.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Where's Stacy?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
No "900" numbers.
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Serve the ball.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Christ!
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
I have a family.
So do I!
No. No, it's okay.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Yeah, what's going on?
What does that have to do with you?
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
Get it.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
We don't know.
Explain that.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Yes sir.
Hello!  Good morning.
Excuse me?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
That insults them.
Pardon?
I do not.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No, but I think I do.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
You don't sew at all!
A lie.  What do you hate most?
What?  No!
It's a folk song.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Oh dear.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
What did you do?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No.
I don't know.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me.  Come on.
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.
Ask him.
I liberated it.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
For?
Top Hat.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
The rest meant nothing to me.
No, now I can't kill you.
Well, she is!
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
Thank you.  Thank you.
Really?  That's sudden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Kip's another one.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
- to her cooking.
You'd better be.
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
Kip… I -
When he dies I'll catch up.
And what if he really is a spy?
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
What's he saying?
Then you were married?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Why didn't I think of that?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
I'm in the middle.
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Uh, yes.
I'll call an ambulance.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
So alive.
You...you can't.
No. Why would I be?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Oh?
Possibly.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
Give him the card.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
What's my problem? You want a list?
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
That's because I wanted them to!
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
We are...for the tools.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
Thank you.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready.
Behind you.
Shut up.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Where the money is.
You've thought of everything.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
There is one more thing.
Call it a new tradition.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
FUCKING THING!!!
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
I sincerely hope not.
Go!
Get out of here!
You mean the seven billion.
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The key to success is using the right tools.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
You change partners, you change the rules.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
What do you think?  What's this?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
All of them.
There's more than one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
So you say.
Yes?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Cause of the chromium.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Five million dollars.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Excuse me?
Lemme see it, will you?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You think there's more?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
No --
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Take it.
Corey.
Good.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
You're married.
Not anymore.
There's more than one kind?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
George!
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
In the conference --
When?
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
I do.
You got more than one?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Better safe than sorry.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
I need it.
Mm-hm.
That's okay.  I understand.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Have you been logging on?
Yeah.  Who are you?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Next week.
Wow, that's soon --
Yes?
The Emperor?
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
No ... there is another.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks and growls at his boss.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Howls.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
He will join us or die, My Master.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
It can wait.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Yes.
Not you?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
That should do nicely.
How do I look?
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
Try and control this ...
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
You look silly.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Are you kidding?
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
We have no use for your kind.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Closer?!
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
I've never seen it fail.
You are reckless!
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
If it must be.  Yes.
That won't be necessary.
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
They suggested oranges.
A display of primitive apparatus --
They look pretty docile.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
I like you.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
What?
He's... near.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
What's in it for me?
I got a new deal for you.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
Somebody get off!
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
I'm here.
So where's Plissken?
No way.
I said pull over.
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
We'll see.
Don't like it, don't come.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
You need help.
Like hell I do.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You're running out of time.
Give me the prototype.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Yeah.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I will not.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well hurry then, and get it.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
You, my lord.
You.
Me?
Love demands it.
He has given up.
I will run.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
You didn't ask!
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
No, he's working on another book.
In here!
And you got an invitation.
Didn't who tell me?
I can't believe it.
What is it?
Phonograph.
Storage.
Me too.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Want to ask him?
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
I just heard them Karl.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
She is going to be well?
What!
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
It affects concentration.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
No.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
On what?
The priest.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
Please.
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
When can I have one?
Oh it's so funny.
I found it.
Where?
The closet
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Here I'll show you.
You think?
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Honey it's to help you.
Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I stole it.
I believe you.
Stealing is a sin.
How's the girl?
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Another one. Had your lunch?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
You and Regan?
Uh Huh.
In time.
No now.
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Holy water.
Merrin! Merrin!
How's your leg?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
She'll go into coma.
Don't listen.
What's this about?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
Little slow tonight.
Mondays.
Your pay.
What about tomorrow?
We don't need you, Frankie.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Baker.
They're falling out.
How many?
No bones.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
My brother and I. One each.
Recognize these two characters?
Two nights.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Jack.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Like an angel.
Count it.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Try the black Knable.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
You gotta go.
Your older brother.
What do you mean?
Her hands.  Like that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's me.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
What?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
All right.  What's your name?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Here, how's this?
How about these?
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
So what do you think?
First night?
Day.  Wednesday.
Last?
Sunday.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
All night?
Yeah.
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Time flies, huh?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
February?
April.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Seventy-one
Shut up, Frank.
No.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, we're not.  Jack?
All right.
The flu.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
How should I take it?
So run a little longer.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
That's the premise.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What-?
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Nine?
Nine!
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Zip me up?
Right.
They're nines.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Hey!
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Great.
Yeah.
Tell her.
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Forget it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
How come?
Job.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
The name's Baker --
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Not for money. With my mother.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
Can't sleep?
Like a baby. You?
In and out.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty  song.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap?
Huh?
You sending me home?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
Vegetables.
Hi.
Losing his teeth.
He's got blood in his eye.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Ever go to church?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Not so good.
Yeah?
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you, Ma.
Fine.  You?
Oh, fine.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
He hit a guard.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Drive.
My place.
Should be.  It's yours.
Shut up.
Only one you've never broken.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Damn right.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Not anymore.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
I mean like protection.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Get rid of them.
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I’m sure you do...
What’s going on here?
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
I don’t know...
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed’s.
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Trouble at work?
I don’t think so.
It’s not Kate, is it?
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Yes you do...
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
I've got everything I need.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
What the hell is happening to me?!
Get out, I call 911.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
It’s lovely...
Need a nurse?
You’re a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Thanks.  To you too...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Yeah...fine.
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because that’s where I live.
Jack...don’t even start...
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
You’re kidding me...
No, she’s not.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
I want it...
It’s good, right?
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Now...I don’t...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
It’s like a museum.
For the week?
A perk for what?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
You’ve been Jack Campbell.  And that’s always a good thing...
That’s the one...
You’re not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
Aspen.
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Hey, are you okay?
No...I’m not...
Last night was great...
I'd like that, too.
So we'll get egg nog.
I've got plenty of places to go.
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben.  Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
Ben!  Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
So are you!
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Not this again --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Dude.  That's my sister.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Reed, we're running out of time.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
If it happened to him, then it could...
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Raising the shields.
Just <u>find</u> him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Medical's ready.
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Say that again?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
With no laser --
Yes, Cora.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You may learn to like it.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
I have no idea.
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
What gives you that idea?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
It's too late now. We must go on.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
What's that?
The Breath of God...
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
It's too late!
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It's possible --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Go ahead.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay, real good, then.
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
Yah, right-o.
Just a general way.
Ya got that right.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
Ya kiddin'!
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Dad's here.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.

Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Really, what's that?
Look at my face.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Some of it, yes.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
I'll ask the questions, son.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
So you're staying in tonight?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Please.
Good.
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
No.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Nothing.
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Who's this?
Tyler?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Is this a test, sir?
Is this part of the test?
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
All gone.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
Yeah.
Can I stay at your place?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
You get the idea.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Is it?
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
Anyone.
What?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You?
Yeah, I'm sure.

Don't mention me.
A liposuction clinic.
We don't need him...

Work.  Going to work.
Okay, and... and...

I thought you did.
Homework assignment.
What is it?
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
... is over.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Um, well... technically, no.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
I quit.
What?
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
Paraffin.
What?
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why what?
I'm doing this for us.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will.  You know you will.
What have you left for me?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
What?
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Let go of me!!
Why?
No, please, no, God, no!
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
I have to save Eugene!
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
No.  What's this about?
...My Premonition was just like his.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
How do you know?
I wasn't worried about us.
I know how it feels to be dead.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah?
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Most kids never have it happen.
Let us out!
No! No! Don't!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
No harm. No foul.
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
That's what I'm doin'!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
What just happened?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
That's what I'm here for.

Home on my strobe.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.

I couldn't get you in.
How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Not yet.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
He... took it.
Nice work.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Have fun.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Colonel.
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
Yeah.  Big time.
What did you want?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Meeting ... people.
Why this is outrageous!...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --

All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
My agent.  I called my agent.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
No, it's not... Come here...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Uh... basement I think...

I'm... just looking for Parry...
He's not here.

Well what am I gonna do with it?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
The Red Knight!
It's a classic.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...

Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You're out numbered son.
OWW...MAN...
No just Parry.
I don't like horror movies!
Yeah.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You got another ball comin'.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I love it.
What the hell is that?
Who said I was depressed?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
What?
Just finish eating.
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
No. How much do I owe you?
Are you talking to us?
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
No kidding.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Daddy's very ill.
He's had two strokes.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It's not that bad.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
My turn.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
That's dangerous, you know.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
The day after tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
You had no inner feeling?
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Shut up...
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
Yes.
What?
What?! I can't hear you!
Just give me a chance, will you?
All right, let's have a rematch.
You're all full of shit!
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Look at me.
What?
Not now, I'm busy
What?
Wussup.
Hi.
Nothin'.
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
I just wanted to see you.
So what's her name?
You got a boyfriend?
That's it?
How you treat them?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I can't!
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Fa what?
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
You said before, that he got boxes?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.
Who?
You sure?
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
Nothing.
Hey!
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
You gotta girLfrLend?
What?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I wasn't asking.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Fletch, this is dumb.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
That a boy.
Thank God, the police.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Gum thought Brazil.
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Thank you.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Are you serious?
Wait a second --
Since he moved to L.A.
Right.
What are you doing here?
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
They bust you every week.
Fletch?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Alan Stanwyk.
Charmed.
I'm all ears.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
Not me.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Only one way to find out.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How long have they been married?
John! You used to fly together!
John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.
So were my parents.
See what I mean?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Hi.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
You ordered it here?
Here, take mine.
God...
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.
Can I ask you a question?
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
That's what I want to know.
You saw a forgery.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
They're trying to kill me!
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
In her cabana, sir.
One.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Sierra del fuego.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
Moved out.
She moved out?
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Irwin...
...never reads the paper...
Looks great.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'd say charcoal.
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I want something I can print!
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
You were going to can me, right?
I was upset.
Yeah.
Who's Frieda?
My secretary.
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Oh... I have some questions.
Nuthin'.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Thanks, I needed that.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
I like.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
You're not funny.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
What?
Peachy.
People still watch that?
Who cares about people?
Are you okay?
Ye-ah.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Go on, another time, another place.
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
Hey, the poet...
What?
What?
Mr. Doyle.
You don't use shit?
Cause if I do.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Doesn't register.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Yeah?
Don't forget anchovies. 
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Who's this --
... Salvatore?...
Yes --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's yours too!
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
We must follow it.
But will they?
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Fake it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Des Moines.
What's he do?
Marseilles.

Yeah, I know.
Why not?
When ya go back on?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
Whip it out.
Policy man in Queens.
The greaser with the blonde.
Yeah.
Let yourself in.
Pour it in your ear.
Four.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
I'm alright, Gibby.
One way to find out.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
The usual.
Did he?
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
You give him his drops?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
So am I.
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Wait...
Queens, New York.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What'd you just say?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
No wait, don't go!
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
What?
Fire.
On the job?
It did, Pop.  It did.
October 12, 1969.
Yeah, it's me.
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
October 22, 1969.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Yeah, you betcha.
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
What the hell is that smell?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Better.
What?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Which means he probably knew her.
What?
Yeah.  Sure.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You work too hard, John.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
Going?  How do you mean?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Where's Shelly?
I'll think of something.
I vote for the hammock.
I love you, man!
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
Don't do that to me!
Be a man, man.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
A hammock?
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Are you all right, Shelly?
What do you mean?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sort of.
I'm sorry.
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Gulp!
Keep looking.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
You don't "have to."
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
We're gonna scare him?!
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Yeah, that's fat too.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
I found it outside.
That's debatable.
Huh?
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Save your...
I'm here.
Yes.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look --
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
So's he and he knows it.
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
She's yours?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Have a good night.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
The fire alarm...
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Am I? Let's find out.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
I...I don't know...
Hi, Sean.
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
Very bad today.
That's where I peed.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Alla puttanesca.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Do we care?
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
Then you should carry a gun.
He'll hate it.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
What are we talking about?
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
She's dying.
She died.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
They'll lose because they're my team.
He will absolutely hate it.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Why do you need a radio?
Is it?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
It's only our first date.
Brilliantly moving.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
A flat-out hit.
Mystery. Deception.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
It's your best play, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
One more out.
This could be it!
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
A grandmother. God bless you.
That's a simple subject.
You're charming the boy.
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Matthew.
Because life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
Why does it matter?
They're my team.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Eleventh inning. What else?
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
Mine was cobalt blue.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
Say it again.
You know what.
One more time.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Never mind.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I'm going home to my machine.
It is the work of untouchables.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
What do you expect when you talk like that?
One more.
Going nearer to God!
No, no -- just a moment, please.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
There is nothing I can give.
Well, that's one victory.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
No?  What's keeping you?
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Something's not right.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Where do we start?
Where did you get this?
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
He's too tall.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
In a corridor.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sure I could have.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Not bad, Jerome.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
I've found him too.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
I know about you.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
Who are they?
Come on.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
We could go together one day.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Beynon.
And you got him...
That's right.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Hi.
You okay?
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Good.
What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Really.
Better than I remembered.
I couldn't have... much longer.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
My mind's not on guessing games.
I see it...
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
She's on TV.
We keep going.
He must have.
Sure?
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
I mean it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I didn't mean police.
When are you going to learn?
I did I killed a man.
Let's do it.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't want to hear it.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Whatever happens it's over.
Things can't get much worse can they?
You and me.
Can we make it?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Just get your clothes on...
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
We walk.
Yeah... I guess it does.
I never have any luck.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
Chicago.
Yeah. I got out.
What about you?
What do you have in mind?
Then you do it.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
Sure am.
That's what I want.
How about twenty thousand?
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?
I'll tell you when.
How?
A couple of weeks back.
Nothing. What could I do?
What did he say?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Yeah.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
Well?
What about?
Never mind.
Christ, what...
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I want to talk to you later.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I work for him.
Yes, I do.
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
He was here for four days.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
We're there now.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Now you're asking.
You sure about that?
Sure I'm sure.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Your brother? What you talking about?
And you didn't know her last name?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
I left last year.
Working at Woolworths.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Nobody seems to know.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
That's what he was saying about you.
Good lad.
Where you off to?
Las Vegas.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
My brother, Frank.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No, you won't.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
No.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
Not much.
And that'll make me feel better?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Piss off, Ray.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the...
I...I don't know.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
Eh?
It's too...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not right.
No.
Eh...?
That's right?
Eh?
...cower in his boots...
He's doing very well.
Yes.
Starting up.
What hard part?
Just the act.
What act?
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
Men come work for you...
They...
They have...
When they...
Yes...?
How?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Well.  Well...
Hey.
Did you?
What did you say?
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
He would take you on.  Yes.
I'm sorry?
You.
I...
Yes.
What does that mean?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Yes.
Because you listened.
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Huh?
They're ancient.
Clear...
It's a waste of time.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They stole the...
To the cops?
Yeah.
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Where was I?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Thieves.
Why?
You think so?
Yes.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Will you excuse us please?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
That's great.
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Did they get my contracts?
...did they...
Would you come in here, please?
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
...I only...
Under him?
Moss.
John.  John...
Yes.
What if you don't close...?
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now.  Yes...When?
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
Yes, I am.
No.  It hadn't.
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
Abso...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
I'm sorry.
Why?
John: John:...my daughter...
Fuck you.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
That's right.
Shelly...!
Guess who?
Fuck her...
Kenilw...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Go ahead.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Yeah.
Mm.
I don't know.
Yes.
Mmmm...
To...you know.
To change our minds.
Of course you have three days.
I don't understand.
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.
Tell me again.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No.  She told me "right now."
She won't listen.
What does that mean?
What...?
I...
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What, "this"?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You did that?
Guess who?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
They took 'em...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Your farewell to the troops?
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
I can't.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Oh yes, the very best.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
How are the kids?
Bought at the airport.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
No.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
No, Dad.
Not for strangers; for my country.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
I never met them.
That's what I'm here for.
Wait'll you see!
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Beautiful.
Within the compound will be fine.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
I don't know.
Yeah, give me a minute.
If I'm wrong...
What was it, so I'll know.
Wait... there's something else.
Mike, at three and a half...
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
This committee owes an apology!
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
Yes, Michael, it does.
His brother came to help him.
Goodbye, Michael.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
You said you were Klingman.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Except the President of the United States.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
When do we talk?
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
I won't keep you another minute...
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I didn't mean to...
Sure.  I loved it.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
I'm not married.
Why?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
Yes!  You know?
Well...no, not really --
Yes.  I trust you.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
But it's just my face you want to draw.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I never thought you were.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
I was an officer.
Do I look okay?
Nothing would please me more.
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Not at all.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's too tight.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Goodbye, Hanna.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
After you then.
Quite.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Righto.  Let me see.
Don't go away.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Is there someplace we can talk?
A boost. A big boost ...
Who do you think?
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I don't want him hurt...
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that, too --
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
One more night --
Get out --
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What do you mean -- ?
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's that?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
You know my back.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
You know my back.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
You betcha --
Castlebeck.
Cadillac.
Needs brightening ...
Keys were in it ...
Good.
It's all microchips and shit ...
We're partners here --
What color?
Gray.
How you doing, man?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
It's arright ...
Yeah...
I think so too --
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
oh.
Of course ...
I know, sir ...
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
Whatcha got left ... ?
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah... You want a ride...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno ...
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
What do you got ... ?
"About what?"
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Me.
You?
Me...
Shadow games ...
De nada ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
The era when crime didn't pay --
I'm cool.
What?
Come here -
What?
Come here -
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Toby...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
What for -- ?
Run it...
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
We're going shopping -- !
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
You look like you lost your sheep ...
Mitch.
On account of me.
And here I am...
Six or seven...
That what you want?
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No ... ?
Oh, yeah.
Unlock your button ...
The alarms go off ...
Now... I'm in ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
How is he -- ?
Yeah ... You -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Bench seats.
You remember Junie?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Are you considering a comeback tour?
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
She left...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She soars -
Excuse me --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Shit all looks the same here --
What? What happened?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I understand.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I'm in construction.
What are you gonna do?
What bag?
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
I got seared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Will you stop.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
We'll pick it up.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
Stop crowdin the plate!
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
I don't know yet.
Next week.
I don't know.
Gone.
What?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
How you doin'?
Good.
Yeah, it is.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
I told you, I just got change.
Shut up.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Somethin's in my room.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Building two.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Fuck do you want?
What're those?
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
I happen to know so.
Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
An integer.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I got your card.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
It's on the college.
You too, Gerry.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
--Gerry--
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
Who is he?
You guys are fuckin' sick.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
I go places, I interact.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
Oh.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
What did you think?
What did I think?
Not to me, they're not.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
What?
What?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Not a chance.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
We'll do that.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
How the hell did you do that?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Fine.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Naw. They paroled me.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
Short fella. Pale face.
Okay. Go on.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Got a warrant?
How many of you?
An' you say no cops?
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
They never wrote you nothing?
All right, you remember the *man* then.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Can't you see that sticker?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
No plants.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
No'm.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I'm ready.
Ya say we're acrost?
Granma's dead.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They know he got hit in the face.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
California, here we come!
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
We gonna take whatever they got.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Morning.
We can pick anything.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
Really...? So what?
Okay. See you later.
Really?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
Overflowing with love.
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, there's not much to tell.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
It's something I do...
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I just know.
Say more.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Morality.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Hard to get good help these days.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
In Portugal, yes.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
This?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
I'll pay.
I'm not happy.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Never enough.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
As long as you had a good time.
That's too bad.
How did you get this job?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
That's good.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
Just who's been laughing at who here?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You too.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Feel good?
Yeah.
Five years. My son was born here.
I am comfortable.
One more time.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
What about him?
Yeah?
Fine!
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I didn't know I had to.
I don't care.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did he mention it?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I said... I started.
When? Tonight?
Why should they?
How's everything?
Good.
Hi.
Who's there?
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Riding with Judith.
Tch. What are you --
How's my pregnant chick!
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Night.
Huh-huh. You?
Let's not talk about that now.
Take your time.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
You want to take a walk with me?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise.
You too, Diane.
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
Yeah.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Have you talked to Tom about it?
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
It's never too soon to start.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
I thought your mom's coming up?
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
How's Pilgrim doing?
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
We still have a way to go.
How much longer do you think?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
How long were you married?
You ever miss it?
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Shh!
The sensitive type.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
...as they snoop onto us.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Difficulty rating?
Yeah?
Curtis.
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
Thank you!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Give it up! Just give it up.
What's going on?
Razor and Blade.
It nibbles. You see this?
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
He's not enrolled in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Name your stakes.
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I'll make it up to you!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yeah.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
Wanna go for a swim?
We caught 'em.
Good.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hey, it's me.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Thank you.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
When did you find this out?
I'm not angry it's just
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
Look.
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Get back!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Has he been prepped?
Outside.
Check him out.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Okay, out.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
It was the nightmare man
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No.
Well try dammit!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Just do it.
Hi.
You won't look pushy.
Okay, bye.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Why?
He's been here.
How do you know?
Least I'm not alone.
Dear God.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Be here in a minute.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Car trouble?
What's going on?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What happened?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
Sure.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Yes, you can.
I want to stay here and watch this.
Come with me.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
He isn't a man.
You all right?
Sure...
I don't think so...
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I promise.
Tommy, let me in!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
No! Do as I say.
She's washing her clothes.
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Mm-mm!
Come in, come in.
I can't believe it!
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
Oh.
You want to see some?
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Hmm?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
And it ruins everything else.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Let's take a look.
Hi.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Ed Smythe, yes.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Where are you headed?
Yeah, you would.
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
I'm...all right.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Is something wrong?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
I am glad to see you.
Oh, honey!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Absolutely.
Hmm?
Yeah.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Stop accusing me!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
You've outdone yourself.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
I'm okay.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I know...I know.
Very good.
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
...you know?  I, uh...
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Oh!
Well, then a third opinion.
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
No, no, we decided!
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh!
Oooo.
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
Easily.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
So what's new?
You got it.
You're too demanding.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
My--uh...
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yes, you do recall, right?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Just a few minutes ago.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
Dad!
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
Some museum director disappeared.
They're offering... 
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
You want me to be?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
I'm not.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
What's up...?
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
That's why my wife adores me.
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Somewhere in Italy.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He is...?
No, no, of course not.
...here's to child abuse!
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
You know it?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
That, that was <u>business</u>...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
...yes, yes, yes...
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.... yes...
Sir, with all due respect....
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Hey, lost again.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
It would seem.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Your Secret admirer?
Goodnight.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
I think your condescension is even better.
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Don't get cocky, girl.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
You did last night.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Don't think.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You goddamn bitch!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Heather.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give it up girl!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Suicide is a private thing.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
I don't really like your friends either.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
You're not funny.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
Next channel, darling.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
No-o!

That was what we were led to believe . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Mummy!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.

Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
No please make yourself at home.
Music to my ears.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
How recently?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Goodnight, John.
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
She can't quit.
What?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
They're really white.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
A man?  Was it a dream?
I've asked him what's wrong.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
And it's a shorter commute.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
All new houses have noises.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
What?
There might be some extras in the garage.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
I think it's time I came home now.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
What did the thermometer say?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Right over here.
Even better.
Even cosier.
Would you?
Uh huh.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Not now.  I'm busy.
They appear to be authentic.
This ties in with Nash.
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
What?
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
And Brenda?
You sure?
Get outta here.
Sing.
That's all?
Yes.
Leaving what?
For what?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
You.
It's done.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
The past?
Sometimes.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
I'll be fine.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
You're twenty minutes late.
I've lived all over the world.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Yes -- it is.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why not?
On the back it has--
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
Get out.
Conner?
What's that next to him?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
That's what the Kurgan said.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
I don't know.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
I think he's dead!
Get to work.
I'm going to my desk.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Not if they're looking at something else.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I'm here.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
My father.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
What do you mean?
Canyon Country.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
We can't make the microwave work.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Go.
She didn't answer.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
What?
Where's the office?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
In my room.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
They're still in the house.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Let me see your identity card.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Let me explain.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
I don't have that much.
And four children?
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
You said you had no whiskey.
Bring back your policemen...
Today.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Listen, you need me.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
What is it?
Fuck you.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Of course.
What?
Murdered! By whom?
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
It will do just fine.
How can we help him.
We have been abandoned.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
No! Sit down now.
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
Many beers.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Where?
On the street.
Can I help you?
What is his room number?
I don't know.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Oh dear.
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
I don't know!!
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Nothing.
The...Fourth of July.
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Up here --
Over here!
Take the gun.
Prove it how?
-- yeah, we did that --
Don't push it.
You need to get out more.
Why not?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Let's try down here...
Better living through electricity.
-- was that??
What --
I know.
-- in the act.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
Question answered.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I was in the middle of --
No, no, it's just --
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
My wife. Where were we?
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Maybe if I --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- no more --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
What's going on?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Why not?
Excuse me?
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --
You say you saw some activity here?
What's the matter?
We don't have proof of that.
What will they tell you?
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
By freeing them.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Who...is Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
She talks to me.
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
Take me to her.
My God, I heard something!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Daddy, please!!!
Good night daddy.
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
I don't know.  That's strange.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Are you ok?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
I think everything's ready.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Aubrey!
Ok...
We're not going.
What's happening!
I'm ok.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
Yes, I am.
May I come in?
Come back to us honey!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
It will not take long...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
Well what is it!
I know what I saw.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Why are you so interested?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Oh, Terri ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Uh-huh.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
No.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
It has already begun.
Not quite.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Why not just go now?
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
Last rites, sister?
You're supposed to be dead!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
How long were you in?
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Oh.  No.
Wha.....
I don't care.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
The Jerky Circle!
Sharp.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Lumbago.
...You do?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Consider this my resignation --
Huh?!
He grins wolfishly.
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Huh?! But, buddy --
An example must be made!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
No, sir.
But, sir! --
Oh my God, sir!
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
Fah from it...
There's one in every story.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She sits down.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She is!
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Ti-Joseph?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
It's my day off.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Did you hear what he sang?
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I'm sorry...
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
Good morning.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I often do.
I imagined this so differently...
Help me? How?
Yes.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Right o'.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
No thank you. We should be off.
I wasn't star--
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Good night.
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Rough day. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
What?
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
See for yourself.
You think I --
I have no idea.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Don't be dim.
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
I'm not.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Yeah?
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Yeah.
But what?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Yeah. You?
Hi Wendy.
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
It's not like we're too busy.
How'd you know?
Educated guess.
No need to make excuses --
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Where you going?
What?
What do you mean?
Moisture! Moisture!
One for you and one for me.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Thanks for the advice dad.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
No one.
Yeah?
Geometry?
Out.
It's freezing.
I'm chewing.
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
There's a TV in the basement.
I don't know.
Wendy!
Huh?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Greetings, Charles.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Her name's Libbets.
What time is it?
Hey Sandy.
Yeah? See ya.
The ones you built?
Just thought I'd stop by.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Vodka?
Okay.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
That's all, for now.
What's that, then?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Twelve years younger.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Worth pursuing?
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Anything.  It's important.
We'll get the other one, though.
Around twelve-thirty.
I told her to come.
What?
That boyfriend.  Randy.
That's right.
Seven years.
That's right.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I'm always all business.
What did he look like?
What is it?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
That's what I said.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Who?
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
I was a mentor to her.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Told you I could write an ending.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
This an accident, Walter?
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
But how did you come into existence?
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I have not spoken to him...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
If you say so. You are innocent.
But why?
How he must have loved you.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
What night? What do you mean?
Is this my birthday?
It will grow back again!
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Why not?
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
Still my beautiful child.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
And no one knows but us...
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
I can't do it.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Sure...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Read her thoughts.
As did the one who made me.
I know. Let her alone.
What are you saying?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
No, I'm the King of the World.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
I've got to see.
What do we do?
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I told you.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
It's...him.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Did you get help?
I guess so.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
How's Julie?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Crowded.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
I'll go find him.
My friend -- what can one say --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Sleep well.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
How old is she?
I was looking for you.
Thea is an orphan.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General — you don't even know him.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Wouldn't I?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
Her family name?
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Oh, now —— now look here ——
I can't understand that.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
Everything's so simple. I like you.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Merry Christmas.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
That's your problem, George Bailey.
George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
They went out of business years ago.
I know that girl!
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Of course it's the place.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Give the flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
All in . . .
Please don't go away –– please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Hope you enjoy it.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Very funny. Very funny.
Did you get a doctor?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
She was here first.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
I'll take chocolate.
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-huh.
Okay –– what can we lose?
Come on, tell me.
Do you like it?
Don't you like her?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Mary . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Going up to see Zuzu.
You forgot something.
What?
Hmm? Well, I . . .
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
I want to go faster!
No problem, no problem.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
I was counting on hours.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
You're betting what you already got.
Sean!  Catch it!
Gangway, Turkies!
Want to talk about it?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
What is it?  What's there?
It's still there!
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
What camera?
Please.  It's my job.
Hey -- you can't do that.
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Too late, it's written.
You're damn right that's what it is.
First things first.
The Shark's mouth.
What shark?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Sound?
Right.
Home it is.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Better yet.
So's a donut.
In the den.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Terrific.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Sean's asleep.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Going out.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
That's what he said.
What's daddy doing?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hiya yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
I've never been supercargo.
Now I really want to see it.
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Help!  Help!
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
I can't stop thinking!
What's that mean?
What about sailing?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Mmmmmm.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Anything?
What the hell is it?
Power line.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
It'll be fun, come on!
I love it.
Coming about....
Might as well.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You going with Patrick?
Coming about, then.
You always go with Andy.
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
No.
Michael....
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Forget it, he won't listen.
With those camera lights and...
He's going with you, Doctor.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
You buying?
Sure am.
Shit.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
Hope I make it through both.
You will.  I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
See you later.
Honey, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Get out of here!
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Just put your mask on.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
Make up your mind.
I know I can capture it.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
Bracelets.
Yes?
No.
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
You don't.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
Well, that's why you got it.
Yes, you can.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
But you --
You don't have to prove anything.
I'm  fine.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
So do I, love.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
What in hell is that?
Let's hope he knows that.
Still sleeping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Not at all.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
They still seem nervous.
I know.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Thanks.
How you doing, Kelly?
Yeah, from Boston.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
What, hon?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
SEAN!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
It's disappeared.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
No way.
It's not closing, Mike.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
He needs a haircut.
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
We're in love.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Chicken....
We need milk....
I'll be right there.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
I have work....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
It went away....
I don't know....
I like it.  Really....
You caught me....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
You make sure they come?
What difference does it make?  It's here....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down.  All of us....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
That....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
I'm on the phone....
I won't....
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
You guys must be starving....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Good.  So will I....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
You look tired....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
No.
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
It could have been an accident....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
But it gets cold in winter....
You're always taking time off....
I like to travel....
Won't you get in trouble...?
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Just like that?
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She said it was coming....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
How's Ellen?
Stop busting my hump....
Try the area around the wreck....
You tagging them...?
We'll pass around cigars....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Money is money....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
So far..
How long has he been here...?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Just trying to be helpful....
'Snuck up on me....'
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
I think you're here all day.
O.K.
What does that mean?
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
So am I. But where's my money?
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
To throw out of the window.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Car accident.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
No.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
Wrong cabinet.
I don't know.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
No I'm not.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Who sought the warrant?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
No, Sir.
I think I've found a hand.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
One of the accountants.
You are not a loser.
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
No.
There is something missing here.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Oh, tell the story.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Well, take care.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Same to you.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
I just got goosebumps.
Happy for us.
Hi.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Yeah, thanks.
-- especially one like this.
Sure.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I think we made a mistake here.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thanks.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
I might call you later!
That's your word?
No, I air-dry.
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Damn right.
Beautiful.
Go.  Flee.
But wait...
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
I'm fine.  What's up?
Dick.
You wanted smaller.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Right up ahead, buddy --
What'd I say?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
What is it?
A bird cage.
People change.
So do you.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Nothing.
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
He's this way.
We have to help him.
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
You mean it?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
DAD!
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
I thought you were an expert.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
They're here.
What?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
KEEP GOING!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
I try not to.
To a degree we never imagined.
Goodbye, Alan.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
On the island.
Why?
You're right.
No we're not.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
It certainly does.
No.  I feel something.
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
-- my --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Come on!
What?  Why?
Good lad.
To collect my fee.
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
What do you think they want?!
No.
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look!  Sarah!
Why did you come here?
Because it exists.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
John Hammond.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?!
What?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, no!
I'm trying!
Can the kid walk?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
The monitors are failing.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Oh my God.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
What kind of park is it?
We're out of a job.
Dilophosaurus.
Yeah, I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
Alan!
I don't know.
They're not here.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
And scary.
Yeah.
Please - - chance it.
Hola, bienvenido
What are we looking for?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say you were scared.
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Let's get outta here!
Who?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
It's safe.
It's safe.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
All night?
All night.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
Don't do that!
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Ken, we've been through this...
Yeah?
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
Who's there?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
What?
_Krueger_...
Who?
Come on.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
He's fucking nuts.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
That's open to debate.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Ten minutes...
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
A man must eat --  And drink.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
And you're late!
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's a farce.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Oskar.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
No!
Leave it, Ann.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Oh my God ... Ann?
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Compassion.
What's compassion, mister.
Did he come around often?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Why isn't he locked up?
I guess he figured it was better.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK?
Can't you get him?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
But if it's someone else I do.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
What am I supposed to say?
I was wondering what that was.
Don't touch anything.
Go down in my room.
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You're going back?
Mm.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
It's in the report.
Goodbye, Pete.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
I know Tom Grunemann.
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
Yes?
He's in his room, playing.
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Not particularly.
What does?
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Greatest...
Show.
Show...
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Uh huh...
We use the green and yellow.
In a minute...
I hate it.
You are not allergic of onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
Uh huh?
You mean for good?
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
See you in the morning light...
It's my name too.
You like it?
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Was there Burger King?
Overruled.
Objection!
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Yes.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
So do you.
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Yes, what?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Any prospects?
Ten.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
I told her you're doing a
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Uh, huh...
Please, Thel...
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Yes, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
Tell me.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
Are you? Of whom?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
General Chiang.
Thank you. Please sit.
It is calm.
I am afraid.
Time to study.
Yes.
Two.
We do not know.
What do you think?
Not until you are eighteen.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
It is an island. American territory.
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
In the Americas.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
The people will not allow it.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always!
You decide.
I have smarter men.
As you say.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
The Chinese.
Yes.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
Eliminate you.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Much too young.
I see that.
Oh, yes.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No crocodile has ever--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Then do it!!
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I don't know!
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
You talk to Bickerman?
Just those two.
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
Eh.  Fuck it.
Guess I finally got bit.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Never been to Maine before?
I <u>told</u> you.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
Good luck.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
What?
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
Really--
You calm down!
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Look.
Well...
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
Take him.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Where is he?!
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
You too.
Did he say anything?
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
I got nothing against--
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
Sheriff.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
It looks like a branch.
I asked you to be nice to him.
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
Yes.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Wait.
Kevin, hey.
Yes, well...  famished.
I'm not even a field person.
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Hot damn, Clarice.
He knew her...!
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Murdered...? How?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
May I see your credentials?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
No. You ate yours.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Mmm. And what else...?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Horses - and sheep...
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No! That's incidental.
What was it?
So you ran away...
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
We leave in the morning?!
Can we rest soon?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Do not.  Promise me.
Maybe...
I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...
There was none!
I sent three men to Webb!
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
I am sorry, Duncan...
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
...Fort William Henry.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Dark haired...
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
I don't understand!
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Yes, sir.
Sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Yes.
Yes.
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Can you fix it?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
What?
Still...you did the right thing.
You screw around like that again and--
Good...It's going good.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
I can't see them!
It bit me!
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Unfortunately.  We can't.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
Hook's on 24...
Russian.
It...almost got you.
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Twelve hours!
Two hundred meters.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Let's hope it holds.
How is he?
I ought to smack your face!
DeJesus...It's got him.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
I'm not touching you!
Seven hundred for the pair.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Well what?
And Tom took care of them.
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Is he on his own?
Let's have a look, shall we?
Try that one.
Sure is.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
How about you? All right?
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
What do you mean, me?
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
For half a million?
It's pay day, ain't it?
I like your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
--you're going to be on your own.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
Because it's a job?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
You got a cause of death?
A .45--
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
What?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
If it's too late--
Come on in.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
He a Black man or an Indian?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
He's still pissed off about it.
No.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Made some money, came back here--
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Yeah?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
That's where he fell.
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Bandidos, Injuns--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
I thought you were married!
We have a daughter.
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
That's a matter of interpretation--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Charley Wade.
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
A little older than Paloma is now.
How come you never got married again?
I was too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Yeah?
For a while.
What do you think?
It's Saturday.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
How much you got left?
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
I'll see what's going on.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Are you okay?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
So she tells me three times a week.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
No--
They've got me. Different thing.
So what are we gonna do about this?
I've felt that way, yeah.
Yeah?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
Gotta be in person.
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Otis what?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
Nix.
Nix?
Who is he?
You ever been married?
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Right.
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
All right.  It was...
I know him.  I saw him.
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Maybe he'll show you.
Be ready.
And you don't ask questions?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
That's my business. Harry.
Yes.  You do that.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
What then?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
Hang on!
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
I think so.
Harry-?
Out!  Out!
Good.  There.  Yes?
You saw this?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
He got up and walked.
I heard he was the best.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you a believer, then?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
When will she be in?
Yeah, I know.
Shut up!
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Help me.
What about?
What?
Yes...
Who is he?
That.
Sure.  Vivovich.
For an introduction.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
He deserved it.
Will that do?  No?
Didn't know you read minds.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
I don't know.
Try.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
One question.
What?
Who is she?
What about Philip Swann?
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Why would I want to?
Liar!
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?
Yeah, I'll stay.
Try twenty-five.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
See you later.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
I see them every morning.
No, you smiled.
I don't remember.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
You're possessive.
I know.
No, yes, it does...
That's ok.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
How old is she?
Fuck off.
Working.
I don't want to be.
That's what you said the other night.
Well, I mean it more now.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Ok, bye.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Can I enter?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Yes?
Take them.
Hello, darling.
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Like Japanese food.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
Hospital?
One moment, please.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
Sure.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
What?
I don't know.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you have to go?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
What happened?
When did they find her?
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Yes.  It's exactly...
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You have to tell me who did it.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Just open the door, please.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Yes... and you are?
And also that...
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Peter, please...
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
What?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
We're going to do this.
Maybe that's my problem.
What are these?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Whish the circumstances were different.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You are the younger of two...
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
It's Detective Smythe.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
How're you doin' today?
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
Child, take a bite.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Need any help?
I can manage.
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Okay.
This time get your feet set.
Careful.
Huh?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
What?
Why not?
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
I told him you looked like me.
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I was just showing emotion.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I'll take that as a compliment.
What's up, Sidra.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Uh huh.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't care.
Okay.
Five seconds.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
Would you watch the damn road?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Good.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Guess not.
Figures.
What?
I know, right?
What'd it say?
I can't be nice to a fan?
What?
My court, I go first.
Right here.
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
What's up?
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Nah.  I have curfew.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
Woman...
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
I forgot, "Q-man."
We won the championship.
Kiss my ass.
What do you mean?
So...how's the knee?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
From basketball.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Your heart.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Hey.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Well, can you give him this for me?
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
What's that, not great?
Uh, your earring?
You hearing me?
I've been hearing you.
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You know, people.
I just told you.
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
In my sleep, Burt.
What's wrong?
Does this sound weird?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --

About two years ago.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
That's great, thank you.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
You take cream or sugar?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.

Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
Well...is that illegal?

Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
DAD --
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
What's up?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
That's right.
You see?
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Yes.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.

I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
I warned you -- I get on a roll...

-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
What am I doing?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?

Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
Does you mother still work?
Are you close?
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.

I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
Psychology major?
Right.
In five years?
What name?  My name?

I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
About three weeks ago.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
Calm down.
I am calm.
No one else in here?
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
Been drinkin' today?
I didn't hear anything.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Then what?
Yeah. Yes.
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Love you too..
Bye.
It's not really pain.
I'm a bad person.
No.  No.
Yeah.
Who?
Rose, I don't --

Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't.
I'm not through asking my questions.
Maybe...I don't...
I don't know.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
You should know better.
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hi.
818-753-0088.
Yeah.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
mmm.hmm.
Water.
Bottled Water?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
What do you do?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
I didn't know the answer --
I said I'm fine.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
...what...?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
D'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am preparing for a ball!
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is nothing now.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Shut up, knave!
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
A body.
I have it all worked out.
And people close to him, who --
Three days??!!
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
To the Bastille.  And death.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Forgiveness?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Athos, my friend!
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos, I beg you --
To kill the king.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Just... water.
Silence!  I order you!
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... You knew you had a double?
He is my brother.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
I must insist, Sire.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
Thank you, Keeper.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely.  It's just...
My dear, I've already done it.
Yeah?
What do you need?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Alright, stay on the phone.
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I didn't hit shit!
Right behind you.
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I'll live...
And what did he do to the girl?
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Yeah?
Seattle.
Only on dates?
You'll find out - soon enough.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Hop in.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Twenty minutes max.
Library of Congress.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Why not?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I am all right.
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
When I'm done.
How do I know?!
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
Don't talk to me!!
Have him peel the top label back.
See if there's another label underneath.
What?
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
In the kitchen.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'm fine.
Yes.
It's me.
Me.
Francis...?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
Hi, Linda. ..
Thank you very much.
I don't understand.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
He asked how you are.
And you said?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I have to see somebody.
Blue is cold.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Then why?
No.
Is Crawford going with you?
Will? Are you okay?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will?  You could come up here.
You going back down to Florida after?
Tell her I called.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
Are you gonna kill him?
...yes.
I got it. Thank you.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why should I tell you?
What disadvantage?
You're very tan, Will.
Yes.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
I don't have one right now.
I haven't decided yet.
Let's walk the route.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Hi George!
What's up?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
You've got good days and bad days.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Oh!
Twenty!
Deal.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
And you're just poor white trash!
And you're just poor white trash!
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Positive.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Where?
There!
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
Bob.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
Know what?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
It's Choi.
I know.  It's her fault.
Two grand.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Hear what?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
An accident?!
No!
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
... Yeah.
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
How?
Any time.
Just get me outta here.
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
Go!  Now!
How do you know all this?
Please.  Come.  Sit.
Why not?
Be what?  Be real?
Far from it.
You've never used them before.
Your training.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
Look again.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
Shit, I'm sorry.
My name is Trinity.
What?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From you.
It's going into replication.
What?
That's different.
Is it?
Should I be?
No.
She told me...
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
What happened?  What did you see?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
We have to!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I'm going in after him.
I have to.
Because...
I'm coming with you.
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
Neo, this has to be done!
Tank, it's me.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
You got sparklers?
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Ok.  Wait here.
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
'And with your spirit.'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
No.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Mind your own business.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
OK, get in.
Get him in.
C'mon Johnny.
$20.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
Charlie, this is business.
Yeah, where's the rest?
Ok.
Oh...around...why?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Nothing.
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Do you have enough?
Well...
I don't mind.
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
What is it now?
Don't ask.
No.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Watch your language.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Friends of yours Michael.
Shut up.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Thanks.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
He's cute.
Very.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
I wasn't going to say --
But what?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Both.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
You mean this, sir?
Hi.
What 'business'?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Am I not obligated to?
'Here'?
Cold.
And a glass.
"Death and Taxes"?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
Yes.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
You have a way with words.
What do you mean?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Yours.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
Joe, you do get around.
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, that's very interesting.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
I from dat nex' place.
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Make it time.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Hi, Jennifer.
Nothing?
Good morning, Jennifer.
As long as it takes.
You're welcome.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Oh yes, I do.
How did you meet?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I came to see you.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Not now.
Excuse me?
And I appreciate you, too.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
No.
To bed.
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
I am.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
-- Yes?
Thank you.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
Yes, Bill.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
What do you mean?
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
You tell me, Bill.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
An offense --
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
'...Yes --'
Death!
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
You should hope quite a while.
Speak up, please.
I didn't ask any question.
I believe you did.
I don't!
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
Please.  Talk to me --
I think you know --
I'm here.
Time.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Hi, honey.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
Yeah.  I guess so.
You're only six-five once.
I know it's none of my business --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
What?!
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
It's something.
Joe?
I don't know.
I'm having a helluva time.
Yes, but --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
I've got patients coming in --
Did I say something wrong?
Y'didn't?
From what?
That's it.
Burt.
What's it like?
Seen you together, that's all.
What?
No, let's go.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Interested in buying one?
Take the money and walk away!
I don't want your fucking money!
Is that what your little note says?
It's isolated.
Don't remember.
Yeah. You?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
What?
Kill him.
Course not.
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
No!
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
About your whore of a wife?
Thanks.
Sweet.
What?
What are you here for?
Well, that's me.
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
I don't know.
Then why are you here?
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You're in a playful mood.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
No! Should I?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
Prove it.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why are you following me?
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
You can't just take it!
What's your twenty?
We know these people...!
Grieve elsewhere.
"And" what?
He any good?
Oh, yeah...
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
It's a rip and a hit.
We're not certain!
Yes you do...
I got the item.
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Deal.
When?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
Havana.
She's dead...
I dance...
I insist.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
Hola, viejo.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
Where would I go?
I know.  And now?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Something's wrong.
Nothing.
Port-Au-Prince.
On my way back...
Verdado.
Verdado where?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Okay.  What's up?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
To recruit you.
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
Yes.  What's up?
...and thanks for the flowers.
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
You set this up!
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
What...?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Lotta rich women back there...
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Sure you're all right?
I know. Scribbage!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
For money.
For money for what?
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
Don't need a comb.
I'm scared.
What of?
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
You're what?
What?
Get outta my way.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for anything.
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Getchmis...?
What?
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Billy?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
For the money... )
Oh Jesus! 
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
Sixty?
How much?
Yes.  I think so.
Just what?
Something like that. Cigarette?
How much did you figure to make?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
It's not fair!
Seven years...
Hello.
What's that?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah!
Jimmy?
Two thirty.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Oh we... we...
It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
Max - where?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
You can't take anything seriously.
My passport!
No!
You're ayip!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Who?
The lawyer?
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Yeah...?
Take a look.
Right.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Just do it!
Oh, Jesus!!
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
Go!! Just go!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Across both tracks!!
You did!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
So?
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
No such thing, baby.
I was just late.
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Just do it!!
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Peter...
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
No shit.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
What?
What are they...?
If you wouldn't mind.
Nothing.
My pleasure.
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
Then who did?
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Nothing.
Not even a hint?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
That's disgusting.
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
Yes, he is.
Buster.
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Well that depends.
On what.
Ahh..
I suppose I did.
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Sort it all out.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
And you're happy about that?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Then we got'em!
..in the building...
Not for seven more minutes.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
- torque wrench.
- this is very disconerting..
Do what?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Ethan Hunt.
Who wants to be decent?..
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Oh Ethan!..
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
You gotta be kidding.
Like?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
Why not?
Yep.
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I told her to get outta there.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Good job.  And thanks.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Do I?
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Always.
May take a little time.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You didn't have to.........
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Bastard!
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Go secure.
Theyíre dead.
Whoís dead?
One hour.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
I don't quite follow you.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
On what?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
We'll see.
Time up.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.
Right, right.  Good.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Jim we canít.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
He's our guy.
Can you lose him?
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
I don't know.
Jack you're so wicked.
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Try it again.
Itís not working.
Run it through from the top.
The Shawfish?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
What?
You're welcome.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
What killed him?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Yeah.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
He's in Palermo.
Let me come and talk to you.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Excuse me.
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
I know that. I do what I want.
He knew my husband who died.
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Why what?
I don't know.
Stupid.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Yes.
I'm telling you your life!
No!
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
I was dead.
I was dead, too.
That light.
It makes you look like an angel.
What?
Take it easy.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
Why not?
I can't!
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
For what?
It's the best thing there is.
I think that's it.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I'm here!
You're late!
We're here.
That's right.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
No. I'm gonna wait.
What!
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
Seven-thirty.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Where's the ring?
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Where you been?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Did you see it?
Oh.
I don't know.
Where is she?
Yes.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
Yes.
I don't know.
Johnny...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
I am alone in the world.
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Yes.
People home.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
It's a house.
Well. That explains it.
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
You're using coconuts!
...What?
Through ... We found them.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Am I right?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Who are they?
Oh!
NI!   NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
No, no ... not "is"!
What?
None shall pass.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
You're a liar.
Come on you pansy!
What?
Look!
Had enough ... ?
I'll have your leg.
Come Here.
You're a looney.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
Bedevere, my Liege.
No.  No.  No!
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
There he is!
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
Man!
What?
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Course it's a good idea.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I don't know that!
Ninepence.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
They cost fifty pounds each!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Listen, Alice ...
I'm ... your son ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Got it?
If we ... er ... 
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Yes ...  make sure ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
... I Bet you're gay.
No, I'm not.
Ector.
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well ... yes ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Shut up.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
Bravely ran away, away.
No, no, no.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye, but will they?
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll get over it.
She means it.
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
The future King!
Out of my way!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Yes.  I do.
Is that the Queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Oh.
Surely --
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
See what?
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am told so.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
To keep out the cold.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Yes, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
Why was I not told earlier?
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
Why not?
What is it?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
How'd you know it was us?
You don't like it?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
What the hell does that mean?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
No, in person.  Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm coming over.
I'm in the middle of it...
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Laurie's.
Let's go around back.
We can't...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
I don't know.
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One.  In case...
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Right, then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
Look around...
We don't have a choice!
There never is.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Is that your question?
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
You have no time.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
You're an understandin' fella.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
You got it! See you later honey.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Good luck, honey!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Was anyone hurt?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
No...I need to sleep.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
I'm not sure about this.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Those men in front, in the car.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
Could be unrelated.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Palmdale.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Not a coke or anything?
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I don't know.
We wait. This is an elevator.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
I'm leaving.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
We drown.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Not quite....
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Thanks...
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
But, he's...
I said NO.
Got it.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Excuse me, sir ?
I am thirty two.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I don't know.....
I can see that but where ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
I meant him.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thank you.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Nothing.
Who was that guy anyway ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Don't mention it.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
So, what's on your mind?
Seriously.
Great.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Totally groovy huh?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
You mean, you knew about me?
You are?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
See you? He can smell you from there.
He likes you.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Your mother?
But we made a business deal.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
No THANKS!
WHAT??
Get married?
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
He is one of the great poets.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
In the tar??
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Part adventure...part miracle.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Bye.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
This is it I guess.
I should do this myself.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Phil for God sake.
You know how I feel about you.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
What do you mean?
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
You have no idea.
O.K.
He is?
Do you know him?
Vada!!
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I think it's still available.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Well the other night at dinner...
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
No kidding?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
Here?
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Kiss me.
Yes.
Good.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'm looking forward to that.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
You can get the general idea...
Did you ahh, love him?
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
The money?
You never cared before.
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
Get away, get away!!
I'm very nervous.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
For this class?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Do you think she is?
Does he love her?
That's really cool.
Oh.
I am.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Thomas?
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Oh great!!
Yes!!
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Okay, get in to bed.
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It'll bleed.
Okay, OW!
Come on, it's fun.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Sorry.
I am not.
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
What?
Stand back.
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Okay, seeya.
Like they do on TV?
No.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Part of being a New Yorker.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
Desperate.  To talk.
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
When I'm talking to children.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Let's not get carried away.
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Can you watch the road?
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly what?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
It doesn't say th...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
W...
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
Quite the little eccentric.
Waiter! Check, please!
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You keep saying that.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
Well.  How come she didn't...
She admits it's her fault.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and you knew about this.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Right here.
Well, it better not happen again.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Hi! Star.
Come on.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Then why are you listening to her -
What?
How did you come in here?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
Your job, huh.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Barbara Jean.
What!
You know better than that.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hal Phillip Walker.
ABC.
How much?
Minimum.
Stop it!
When is it?
How come?
To the bathroom.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Hi, Sherry.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
I think we can do that. Come in.
A little. What do you need?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Need a ride?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Get in.
Nash.
What year?
Sixty-three.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
How do you know if they do?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
And before?
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Hi.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
Wow!
What?
I can't.
Car pool?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Older than thirty?
That's what you said before.
I know. Goodbye.
Premeditated murder.
I see.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Linnea?
Yes.
It's me. What is it?
I'll be there.
How much?
Hello.
Yes.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
I mean...
Mary?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Hello.
Why?
What?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
You always live there?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Who?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
More or less...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
You got something you want to do?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
You've heard of it?
She was born without a tongue.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
Anything.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
Not good.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
Don't worry about it.
Was what worth it?
Describe Mallory.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I do, too.
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Take a wild stab!
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Wayne Gayle.
Wayne Gayle!
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
How 'bout Mallory?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Slate it.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Out.
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
What d'you say, Duff?
Hell, you got steady work.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Where's he at?
I don't know.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
I don't know.
Well, he worked around.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Yeah, I been there.
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
No thanks.
What is it?
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
I'll see you later.
What's he like?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
Well, what d'you think?
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
You didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
How come you keep askin'?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
There's nothing to say.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Duff--
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Like what?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah, see you in hell.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
I heard you.
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
That's right.
How 'you gonna live?
Hell, I'm just like him.
Good-bye, Duff.
How are you?
All right, son.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
It's for your own good.
I'll be seeing you.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
That'll make the folks very happy.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Anything you say, baby.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Of course...
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Good, because you've got a new one.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
No, but it traced me.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
The words?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I don't have a girl.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
It's Case. Remember me?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
We got problems topside.
Less than thirty minutes.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
How's the ice?
You haven't got it?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I don't know. I don't know...
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What's that supposed to mean?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Give me five minutes.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
What is it?
Hold on.
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, do you?
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
YOU KNIT?
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
If you say so.
Who told!
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.

Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
You crossed over.
Do I want to be crunched?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
They hid my car--
Dude, you rock!
Hey. There.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Little known fact.
That's the spirit!
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Thank you.
You remember that story?
Don't look down!
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
To put us back together again when we fall.
Yeah, actually I do.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What?
I don't know.
Who are you guys?
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Barrel.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
For this.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Good.  I'm hungry.
No.
Why not?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Don't be a smart ass.
No.  Upstairs.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Ken!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Only the wet ones.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
It's happening again.
Ah, nothing.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Make a left at this corner.
What's this?
What do you mean?
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
I'll get over it.
What is it?
Oh, Jesse...
You want to talk about it?
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Hi.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
First door up the stairs.
Can't it wait till morning?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
I think so.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Call me Nancy.
Didn't get much sleep.
Well, we've got --
Never been here before?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Doesn't matter.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
What are you talking about?
What?
Listen.
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
C'mon.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Oh God.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Night, night, Honey.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
Here, let me help.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Okay.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Why?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Oh no no -- no.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
My son's name is Johnny?
What do you think?
Yes.  Always have had.
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
What?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Don't ask.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Who is it?
Yes.
What's your name?
Rufus.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
And this is William.
The movie star?
Yup.
No!
Don't even ask.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Yes, I think that one may be.
That's nice.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
It was good.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
Yes?
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Any bit in particular?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
She's perfect, perfect.
I believe I have.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Does she know you're coming?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Absolutely not.
What?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Three.
Oh.  Right.
Fabulous.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Tell us about it...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
No! No! No!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
Right!
Go on...
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Go ahead! Go back!
Yeah, kid?
M-M-M-Mack?
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Come here!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
They went that way.
Hey, what's that?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Shhh...
Me, too...
Me too...
My feet hurt...
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That!
With your own two hands?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Okay, sucker.
Just warmin' up.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I said out!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
You can come back later!
Scanlon out!
No!
Why not?
Just wait till you hear...
Yesterday...
Gary Blinker...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
That's a dime, Martini.
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
A nickel.
Bye-bye.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He is!
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Good. Good.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Shhh!
Are you a doctor?
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
What's going on?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
Shhh!  This way!
Sure...
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Martini out!
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Just great!  See ya around!
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Oh, yeah...
Yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
Hi.
Big man!
Yes, ma'am...
After you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Asshole.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Is everything all right?
At this hour?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
What's that?
What?
That!
Is he in an asylum?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Because.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What great aunt?
No...
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
What's mezzaluna?
Okaaaaayyyy.
What?...
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Non.  Please.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Hi.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
What?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
You would?  Really?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Really...
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
It's a coincidence.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
You don't have a passport.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
Right.  My brother.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Oh my God.  Where?
What?
Good luck.
I meant about my idea.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
...and a fortune teller.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
What about Larry?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh.
Huh?
What?  You know him?
Where is she?
Sorry...
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
It's a living.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Hello, Edie.
Tommy, what happened?
Terry... Terry... .
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I better see you get there.
You training to be a nun or something?
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.
I don't know.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Go ahead, wear it.
Terry, what's wrong?
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Well, it's over.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Pop!
Let me by.
I'll find you a priest.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
This is my business.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You go to—
What do you think?
What about it?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah, really!
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
No?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Hit me again.
Easy. Easy, boy.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Hey, Terry, front and center.
So-so, Johnny.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
My favorite little cousin.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
What do you mean?
I was only talkin' to her.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Maybe I will— one of these days.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
In there.
It frightens me.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
What do you mean?
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Of course I do.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Well then let us proceed.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Without the snake, of course.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Just that she got away.
I'm a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Yes, she did.
Yeah, I did.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
All you gotta do is get in.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Another C.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Someone down here?
Nervous?
A little.
In my bag, in the car.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
We still talk, though.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
How do we do that?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why not?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It smelled.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
So do you.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why not?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I see better with them on.
The backseat.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
For a time.
Meaning?
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I'm freezing my ass off.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Right now, son.
How you know that?
I can tell.
I <i>was</i>...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
What did you call it?
It's a --
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Huh.
Off a tip?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
It's possible.  Why?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
That's right, just me.
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Still...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Where the fuck is Foley?
Are they dead?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
No, I was.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
What the hell happened to you guys?
No, like...
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Home of the brave.
I'm out of fuel!
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Yes you can.
From the air?
Hang on.
Y-Yes Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Explain what?
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
You too, 'Mam.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Learn English, then!
Peggy Sue!
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Good—bye, Grandma.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, how are you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
I just can't trust you anymore.
How'd you know about that?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
I'm trying.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Touchy, touchy!
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
What, why?
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Coffee and a donut.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
How do you feel?
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
The house payments.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Maddy's party.
Way to go, Mom!
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Why not? They're my favorite.
Rosalie Testa!
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
When do we start?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you doing?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
It's been a few years.
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
All set.
Anywhere but here.
Zowie.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
He was dead. You know he was.
Maybe it takes a while...
What do you mean?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
In a word, Bob...
Charles is right behind me.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
Drew!
I promise!
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I'm not going to die.
Ready for what, baby?
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
More than your friend. Family.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
About my blood work?
Funny.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
Your... lover?
As in, the vegetable?
What's her name?
No. They didn't fire her.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
It's me, you dork.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Not bad.
Get it?
You're right.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Do you... pray?
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Thank you.
A good start.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Do you take risks?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yes.
No. I can't really see it.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Is that a question?
Why are we going to do that?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Get real.
Uh.... No. Not really.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Great.
How many do you know?
Who?
Since when?
Yeah... ?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Dr. J.!
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
They're coming.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Big Evil?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Like my pistola.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Never said you were a hype, either.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Some prophet guy?
For now.
Riddick?
What?
And what about the cells?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
You mean....
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Please...this solves nothing...please....
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Not staying in here another....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
What if you're one of five?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What do you care?
So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
Neither do I.
Remembers what?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
You didn't think so then.
Yo!
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Sustained.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
A hearing.
Which one?
Second from the left.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
It's humiliating.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Like you, I find it difficult.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Where?
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Says he can't walk.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
'Lias come naturally.
Over here!
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
...there's nobody.
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't know.
You don't know.
No thanks?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Okay. You win.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
I didn't say anything.
No thank you.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
There wasn't any plane.
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
Dance? Here?
Then he's-- 
We'll find out.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
No use waiting, then.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
Frozen.
That, and the fun of it.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
That's an evasion and you know it.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Morning. Any calls?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
You, Killaine?
Leave that one lay.
So you're not a cop.
I've got good ears.
A private joke.
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
If I can get off.
Well--good night.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
So it seems Sergeant.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
Oh nothing.
Warm water, no doubt.
Not quiet yet.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does.  May I go now? 
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
But you still think she's innocent.
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
It's kind of you to see me.
I think you'll do very well.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
I see.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
No.  I'd want to--
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Who?
Well, you know...
Did she talk about me?
Might?
What did he want?
In your car
Why not.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
You approve!
Let me see.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Hello.
Suez.  1956.
They don't count.
Dad.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
'Night.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
De nada.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Okay!
But you're not alone.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
You never were...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
What?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
This Zen master surfer.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Nothing.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
What?
Warm them up.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
My name's Johnny Utah!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
No more games.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Right behind you.
Anytime.
It's been a long time, General.
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Hope to be?
What?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
No.
Stolen?
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
You're joking.
Fine.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
Exactly.
Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
No shit.  They expensive?
What?  Why?
Vivian --
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Done.
Holy shit.
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Come with me?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Dinner can wait.
He died a long time ago.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
I'll guard them and you with my life.
The opera.
I know.  I'm glad.
Did you?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
What do you mean?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
No.
I'll bring it back.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Do it.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
I'm up.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
He's not gonna want us.
Yeah.
Who did you think?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
I... Edward...
Vivian.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
You'll like it fine.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I was in here yesterday.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
There will never be a need.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.

What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.

Veer left. Left. Left!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time. 
If there are, we'll all be dead.
It's you.
True!
I don't think more than ten.
But you don't know where he is.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?
I have a little.
What?
Open it up.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I don't understand.
Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Not yet.
Light him.
In that case --
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Hah?
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Again. Thank you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I am not left-handed.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
That would be inconceivable.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Morons.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Have fun storming the castle.
A little bit.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.

You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Ooooooops.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
Well, sir, it seems ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What was I saying?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.

Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
No.  We go. 
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.

No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
We can't... we keep our money there!
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Groovy!
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
What do you mean?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
Who are you, friend?
Money.
Must've needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Just what he told your detective.
Lila.
Is Mary here?
With you.
Where?
Don't you know?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Huh?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
You'll never find it.
Contemplate your... panic button.
In a hurry.
Well?
Huh?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Hospital clean.
What?
Bates.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam. This is the last time.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I can come down next week.
All right.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
You have a vacancy?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
You'd know, of course.
No, not like me.
Norman.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
Good night.
Is anything wrong?
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
I don't know what you've been saying.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Leave me alone!
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I don't know, [I tell you].
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
He isn't here.
I'm going to call the police.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Yes!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
But ... the dogs...
No!  Good night!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
The body of Joan Gale!
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
What!
Almost certain.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
How's every little thing?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
Thanks.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Who'd steal her body?
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Darned if I don't! 
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
He can't hear you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Excuse me???
Yes....
Day or night?
I'm heading out of town.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
In what sense were they bad?
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But Rose...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You're my sweetheart.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
What are they doing?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
A wonderful woman, boy.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Yes, we know her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Fine.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Your baby?
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
She has other things to do, Dave.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Abe Lincoln...
She's fine, as if you cared.
What'd I say?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Save it.  Just go.
No you can't.
Get ready.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Wh... what... ?!
Dean Martin.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Same day as before.  I think.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Can't I?
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Just got here.
How'd we do?
Your wish is my command.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Keep 'em busy.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't see.
Jabba's palace.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
I don't know.
Hold me.
You love him, don't you?
Lando!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
You, too.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Your Royal Highness.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
But, why must you confront him?
I will not fight you, father.
I will not fight you.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh don't be so shy.
Yes.
You're OK by me.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Cross my heart and hope to die.

Rice is a bum.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I said that before.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Check the eyes, Ben.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Damn! How's it look?
Would you keep goin'?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
'Bout what?
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
What?
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Oh, no...
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
That's right, me.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Does it hurt?
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
I didn't know who I could trust.
He's right here in the...
Eddie, come on.
Wait here...
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
That was the idea.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Tempt not a desperate man!
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Out--
Of love?
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
A most courteous exposition.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Do you really think so?
You know it is.
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
You lose them!
Not yet...
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
Is that right?
That's right.
Just business.
Bloody fucking hell...
I'd stake my reputation.
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Shut up!
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Bad company...
What do you mean?
In here...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
You'll die if you leave here.
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
I swear...
Then where is it?
A post office box.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
There is one other thing...
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
It's been known to happen.
My way is better.
Who's they?
Everybody.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
No thanks.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Know what?
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
Yes.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
It is at that.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
I don't know...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Just like that?
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
And now...
Finish it!
You speak French.
What of it?
Nothing...
Gone.  Destroyed.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Why didn't you kill him?
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
The Russian would be easier.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Oh, you would have done great.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Because...I know.
What's that?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Neither do I.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
No we're not.
Then Sally comes too.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's NOT too late!
By Friday.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Hi.
Nothing.
Yeah I'm fine.
I love you too.
You deserve it is the occasion.
That son of a bitch.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
Yeah.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
What are you getting at?
Dwayne.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Well I don't know...
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
I can't hear a word you're saying!
That hasn't stopped you before.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Calm down --
Right behind you.
I think I am.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Money.
Not in the trunk.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
We're going to find out.
I'm not getting an answer.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's right.
You bring American money?
No.  It's my first time.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Try to land on your feet.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
Don't look at my ass!
Who died?
You.
Not Yu.  You!
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
You said --
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
How do you know?
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
It's a bomb.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
How was the sex?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
I'll give it my best shot.
MMMMMM!!!!
No you didn't!
Just GO!
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
The Plaza Hotel?
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
I need your help.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
This is pathetic.
He was just doing his job.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Witnesses.
I know a shortcut.
What plate?
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
No. I just made it up.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yeah, it's good.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
It's him.
What?
The art.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
She's fine.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
All the gory details.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Then you'll be my best man.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You know, your daughter seems...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
You afraid to try?
You don't know.
No.
Of course.
No.  You take it.
Can you fix it?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
So am I.
So, we'll...
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm just finishing up, too.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Am I what they had in mind?
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
And then I'll see you in New York --
No.
I do.
I told you.  Nothing --
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Look!
Whatever it is.
What's with you?
Nothing's with me.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
Yes.
Listen to this, I love this part --
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
Good night.
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Made for each other.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Are his folks nice?
You know.
What?
Sure you do --
Magic.
It's me?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I don't think I could really describe it.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
She died.
Why not?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Right, right.
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
It's never happening again. Right?
My feelings exactly.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm starting to notice that.
Will she scratch up your back?
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
What was?
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Not now, Jonah --
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
Okay.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
That's true.  Why is that?
I just called for a second.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
It might be in the kitchen.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
It was all they had.
What about it?
Do you like it?
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
What do you mean?
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
It takes time --
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It never ends.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
So much the better.
An American.
No, Estellita.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Aaah, what's the use?
No, no ...
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Luís told me.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
They say I am no good to you.
Over my dead body.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Backward.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
You weren't waiting for me.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
No. New York.
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Are you Australian?
No.
Shhh.
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Everything go?
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
That bad, huh?
I can't.
Why not?
You don't understand.
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Never heard of him.
It's the only way to play.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You really need to lighten up.
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
I been that way ever since.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
What?
It's Tom.
Midnight?
Lead the way.
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
You on a roll?
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
But I just met you.
I'm sorry?
Big Bill.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
You go, boy.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
It's not my place.
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
It speaks!
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
He's the only one I told.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
They have. But they never found a lab.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I was talking about Miles.
There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Just admit you're wrong.
Why are you doing this?
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Better than drugs.
Don't worry about it.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Of course, sir.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Keep trying.
To each, his own.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
Sarge?
You think the rest of us were?
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
Same place we are.
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
I changed my mind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
I've got a line on one.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Good news?
You never know.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
Let's just find someplace.
You want me to take over?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
I'm listening, sir.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Get back to your positions!
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Alright, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Lingerie.
Yeah?  So?
Captain, he's fast!
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Twenty-four-five.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Speak with my lawyer.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
And your former wife.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
I still am.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'll be home soon.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd, give it up.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
See you tomorrow.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
Read it.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What is wrong with this girl?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
I'll put this past my boss
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Goodnight.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I like him a lot.
Just finishing up in here.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hi.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
Look at those eyes.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Well, not monumentally.
I'll go.
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
You know what?
What?
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Mmmm.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
Well... just meet her.
Friends with potential.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
I don't think so.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
Yeah, uh-huh.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
What?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
The truck?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Your car?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
What?
Hey.
How you doin', brother?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you too.
Sir, the list is correct.
What -
War.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
You did, but you didn't.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
Things are great, things are great.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I need a drink.
I think it's too late.
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
Don't. Think Bailey.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
That's smart.
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
No, it's me.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
Not until you’re dead.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.
You’re not going to get away with this.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Randy somebody.
I got it..
I find his work overwrought.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Or it found us.
Tuition’s expensive.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
Yeah?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
We'd break some furniture.
And Joel's pre-med.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Humor me, Sid.
I'll give you one guess.
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
Watch your back.
It's good to see you involved.
But who would operate your camera?
Oh my God.
I don’t know.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Is Sid in therapy?
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
Yeah, right.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
But...
Now.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
He's after me.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Asshole, Can't talk.
What kind of a game?
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Reaction to what?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
There's more.
Absolutely.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Who's this?
Who's this?
I'm hanging up right now.
It is in my script.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Go there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
No one's saying you did.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
It's okay. We need to talk.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Stop it!
Who is this?
What number is this?
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
Don't...
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
Which is it?
Turn off the light.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on, yes you do.
I can't think.
YES!
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Answer the question and I will.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I'll get my camera.
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
She's tough.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Call the police.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
I'll send you a copy.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
Right here.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
How do you gut someone?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Later.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
It's alright. I'll get it.
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
I did. He's full of shit.
How's that?
I'm in.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
Good.
What?  What?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Her pretty head.
NO!
You'll see.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
For now.
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
Tonight.
What about them?
I read.  Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
Punishing.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Call an ambulance.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
Oh, it's alright.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
I don't know... like fifty.
I don't.  Neither do you.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
I'm fine.
What happened?
It was him.
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
No point in arguing anymore...
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Where's the victory?
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
Give me a break.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
I ain't wearing no gun.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Dunno...Seems so.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
By what you preach...none!
Captain Clayton...Captain!
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Told ya, didn't I?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You got it with you?
I beg your pardon?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Whatchu doin'?...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Not likely.
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not far from it...
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
I got to fetch her home...
We got two around that age...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Oh God, Tommi...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Someone from the village.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
Very funny.
Oh
Right you are, governor!
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Twenty pounds on delivery
No Juliet?!
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
No, no. You have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
There's never any
Of course not!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo.
The show must … you know
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
And yours?
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
I am not so well-born.
Stand up straight, girl.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"She speaks.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Even your play.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
How does it?
My lord.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
A man, my lord?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
About what?
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Why, thank you, David.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
No.
Juliet?
And what about you?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
I want to talk now.
After.
I don't know.
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
There was a break-in.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Where do you think you'll go?
But there's no --
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
Parked outside?
That's all?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
You're right.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Open it.
Now?
Yes.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
Don't.
Don't look?
No.
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
And now you tell me.
David?
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Who was it?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Don't you?
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Oh.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
I see.
What?
What?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Of course.
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Would you like to talk about it?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
What?
Who have you talked to?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
I'm not sure --
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
That one, last week.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
A priest who dies.
I see.
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
I'm a doctor.
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
My keys.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I know.
I'll be back in a while.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
Nummers.
What?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
Yes.
What about?
I don't know. Just a minute...
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
She what?
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
Nobody can hear it.
Let it ring.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Are you?
No.
Hello.
A little.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
Don't make conversation with me.
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
You are.
Yeah.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
Right, that's right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Well, I do.
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
Yeah... I mean great.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Do you? You still see him?
Why not?
And what?
Did you?
Did I what?
Hey, I don't tell.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby...
You're a genius.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
Jackie, can we --
Fuckin' A --
-- what?
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
We're friends.
-- sure.
Nothing.
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- yes, you --
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
-- you've got to leave.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
It's too late...
I don't know... Jackie?
Don't go, Jackie...
Oh yeah?
Wash her.
What with?
-- Oh my yes.
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
Okay... thanks...
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
You said somebody... who?
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Fine. How are you?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Yeah, baby.
Why am I great?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Could I?
Egypt!
I already said hello.
George.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Television or movies?
Commercials.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
What difference does it make?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
Did you?
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
But Mr. Norman said --
Yes it is.
When?
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
... this doing hair it's...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
What do they look like?...
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
Okay, thanks.
Me!
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
I'm finished with her.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

No.
Awww --
Come on by.
I'll call you back...
Okay, okay...
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
What do you mean?
A daytime soap opera.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Yes.
No kidding? Your own shop?
You're still jealous.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Why not?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Well, what is it, honey?
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
How much?
Jackie --
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Sort of.
-- never mind.
Good for you.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
-- oh I don't know --
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
That's fine --
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
-- just wonderful.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
John...
Everybody but us.
Where to, Les?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
They had to, in order to survive.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Yes?
What?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah.
Yes?
I won't make any noise.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Oh!
Why not?
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Yes, I'd like you to.
Thank you.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Nice to meet you.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
What'll it be, sir?
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
No, nothing at all.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
I think he did it to himself.
You can't remember.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Of course you are.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Get down.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Great...
Well, my predecessor in this job
Well, that is eh quite a story.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Let me help you up.
Went shopping. Why?
Will you?
Well... it is his third.
What kind of noises?
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Do I need one?
Good.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
What you say?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
Were you tempted?
SING!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
With love.
Yes?
Thanks.  A lot.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
That man -- who is he?
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Whatever.
Um, I don't really know this one...
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
What?
Sing!
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
Three years.  A rookie.
A novice.
Now you.
Experience!  Right?
Right.
You watch yourself!
Keep moving!
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Again?
Bless you.
It's true!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
You were unhappy?
What?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
And all those like you.
Check your driver's license.
The vow of obedience.
Like to who?
Your cell.  Your room.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
You're my Olympic event.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The majority has spoken.
You have a phone call.
Good day.
Saving you.  Move!
I'm a Christian.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Then-you run.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Even nuns have to pee.
Hail, Mary.
But -- wait.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
Take care of it.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
Which one!
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
But how do we get there?
Impossible.
Yes?
I know. 
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Find 'em!
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
What is that?
A diseased monster.
Bring him.
You need rest.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Witches do not exist.  However...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
What happened?
Stay back.
Why this tree?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
What was she doing?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
Tired.
Small talk.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
Just... keep where you are.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Come with me.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
I do not know.  Away.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
We have no choice.
Use caution.
What did you say?
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
Sit.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
You got any money?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I thought I told you to keep out!
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
How come?
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Why?
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
It was fun, anyhow.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
I didn't aim to.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
Not really to speak of.
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Why won't he talk to women?
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge. 
And your father? Is he from New York?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Do me a favor, will you?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
You usually get two.
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I mean, it's a good story.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.
What can I do for you?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
I figured he had a right to know.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You don't.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
I said.  No further questions.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Why?  We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Won't take two.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
You're right.  I better use two.
You're wondering why I held it.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
I think you like learning.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
No.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
Get lost, will you?
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
What did he say?
Of course I am.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
With you.
They got the bull-fiddle.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
And I'm Daphne.
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Good night, Josephine.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
Have I got things to tell you!
I'm engaged.
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Like what?
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
Get me Room 414.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Terribly sorry.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a very sick girl.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Thank you, Daphne.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Oh yes, we do!
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.
I always did.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You must be quite a girl.
Goodbye?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Come one!
You ain't going nowhere.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
It's three weeks in Florida -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I'll say.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Who are you?
Now, really -
Your face is familiar.
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Is it that hopeless?
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Good morning.
Let's make it an even million.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
You shave with your spats on?
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Except it’s Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Are you sure you’re okay?
I’m fine. I promise.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
Oh, don’t be that way.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
You are taking the piss?
I had to say something to get you here.
No, that’s not it.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
You have feet?
What does your gut say?
You’re too good for him.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
It’s cute.
What is?
A wedding.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Shampoo, got it!
What?!
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Hi.
I have to.  I’m the best man.
I’m so sorry.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, don’t be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
That does it...
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What he talk 'bout?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Can you swim?
Yes mam...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.

Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Children, come here...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
Mornin'...
I'll wait till after the children.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
I am the clitoris.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Very funny!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Whoops.
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Oh yeah.
Eric?
A hunger strike? For what?
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place--
What?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
FREEZE!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
For pooping, silly.
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
It isn't fair!
How do we do that?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Totally!
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
What is 'fisting'?
-Or monkey fucker-
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Right away, ma'am!
What the hell is going on?!
Oh God... What have I done...
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
You would know, dummy.
Canada is saving us!!
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
I am.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Hi Stan.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
And ze rope?
Check.
And the butfor?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna...
Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
They are awaiting further information.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
Well shut it off at once!
All right, I'll give it a shot.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
That's me.
I know, I know.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
That's clear.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What?  What are you talking about?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Send it back if you don't want it.
How am I supposed to know?
What makes you so sure?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
It belonged to my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
I hate fuckin' opera.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
No kiddin'.
I'd buy it!
See ya 'round Faz.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Theo.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You wish!
He says that to all his wives.
Hello, mom?
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Junior.
Junior who?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Leave him alone!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
He's no father to you.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
Coming right up.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
No, not at all.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Why were you suspended?
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Plan C...  ...is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Tell me what happened Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
You should.
At least I'll die smiling.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Suck my dick!
Lips still for sale?
I'm not here to bowl.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Who identified the body?
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
I can't...
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
Nobody move!
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
That's our reserve air.
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A thousand feet.
Then why am I here?
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
Take a look.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I think I do.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
Jerry?
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing, sir.
In the ship, sir.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
How do you mean, strange?
What -- you want me to retype it?
She wired this system.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
To what?
Internal power.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What?
Beth --
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What are they?
Eggs.
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Don't tell me to calm down!
You bastard.
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
None of this was here before.
You don't believe me.
I don't know.
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Sintag.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
Causes sleep.
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Beth --
For what?
Not believing you.
Where are you?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Is it?
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Get away --
It doesn't make any sense.
By the bunks.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
In time for what?
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Look, would you --
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Gimme another explanation.
No.  I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's like...
You remember opening the door?
Then explain it to me.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Beth left?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
That's right.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Well, press something!
Wait!
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
That's right.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Thank you.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
You've heard of me?
What report?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of.  Why?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I don't know.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
I'm not afraid of anything...
May the Force be with you.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
I'll make a report later.
Was this trip really necessary?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
I think I did.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
He'll be well cared for.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
You got it bad.
I got Games & Theory.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I'm getting better.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
A funeral.
I do.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Your turn...
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
How do I know if this is love ?
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Who cares ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
That was just a mix up.
See you on the bounce !
Thank you, ma'am.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Flip six, three hole.
You got it.
You used to dance...
What ?
All bands.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Hi, mom.
You can never be sure.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Who's that with you ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
The Creator has not answered.
The information will not be disclosed.
<U>Answer</U>!
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Twelve seconds...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
You bringing your new friend?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You bet your life.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
"Anguish."
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Why did you quit?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
...that.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
About <u>conflict</u>...
I...
Yes.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Cast stood me up.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
Oh.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
I can't get it to come out right.
I hurt you?
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Where you going?
Going home.
No, that's true.
Gosh, you look nice.
It does?
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
After Drama Group.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What're you doing here...?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
Now: I'm looking at the...
They think it's your First Wife...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
Isn't he...
It's...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
We've got three days to...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
Just him and me.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Could I see it please...?
If there's anything I...
There's other things to be learned.
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Who is it raped you?
We know that you weren't.
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
Who is that...?
That's my...
Oh.
Claire, Bob Bar...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
You can't do what?
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...wants a piece...
Yes.
We, we have to give it.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I'm only trying to...
Bob are you alright...?
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
That isn't very nice.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Well.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
He didn't have to tell...
Later for you, pal.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
A witness to what...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
Where have you been...?
Why?
I treated you like a son or nephew.
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
Find the money.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Why would they be illegal?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I killed her!
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It happens.
Why does Rachel scream?
During sex.
I live.  In the same country.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
I'll be there for you.
Well.  It's for you.
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Not with my mouth open.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Don't. Take me with you.
Good.  That's very good.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
This is my house too!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
That's my girl...
Don't take my picture!
Annabelle put down that camera.
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves you.
Then have a donut --
Alright starve.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Before you.
How do you know?
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You say that like I don't know that.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Let's take our best shot.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE are over.
And we all went through that together?
I live or I die.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You got to hell!
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Yes?
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Don't flatter yourself.
But I came here to...
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
And you said...
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
I trust you of course I do but --
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Because you've changed so much.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Don't ever say that.
He isn't.
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Great to be here.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
I'm still poor.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
But really, you never know.
For rape and murder.
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Yes, Mikey?
Got a lot of homework?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but –
Just the same.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
Thanks.
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Great!
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
I know.
Is it loaded?
Yeah?
I mean...
No, thanks.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
What do you think?
Yeah?...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Well Cooper...
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Where does it lead?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't want any...
I insist...
Agreed--let's move it.
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
There's enough in one vial...
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
I know nothing of the sort!
Give that back to me.
That's right, fella.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What did you say?
General Schmuck?
What did you say, sir?
What kind of trouble?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
This is General Ripper speaking.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
War.
War?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hang on, boys.
Primary arming switch.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master Kong.
He's dead.
What happened?
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Then get off my back!
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Can I have some?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Yes.
Typical male.
Typical male.
What's it about?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Where are you-hoo?
Shut up! Aw...
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
The dude wants it.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
A long, long, long...
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not worried.
Hey, you know me.
Uh, last night...
You know?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
No, no, no.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
In what way?
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You better! Yes!
I will.
This is private property, my friend.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
No, no, whoa!
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
A reel?
Come on. Inside.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Yes.
He is.
He is.
A Porsche.
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
It's a mistake to think that.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Pony and I are friends.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
You don't know?
No.
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
Look, your trespassing.
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I know, I know, I know.
I hate that.
Yes.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Yes, I stand for -
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
Us.
Come with me.
Mm-hm.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
I, yeah.
Mm.
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You're unbelievable.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Go.
What?
Just go.
Yeah, good.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
For a while.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Is that your driver?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Like?
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
You done?
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Cleo!
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Positive.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
You sure I'm not fat?
He Ikea'd us.
Kim-Lo?
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Bullets.
Kansas?
All of you!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
That was the general idea.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Thanks.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Well....
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Life can be beautiful!
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
So long.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Nobody can be that busy.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's who?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
It must be my new shampoo.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
You did.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Hello, Mr. deMille.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Who else ?
Of course it is.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
What month?
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
I'll come early tomorrow.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
What's wrong with It?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Come on!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
The other guests?
"Mad about the boy."
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I think I'll read a little.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Dressed for what?
For me?  Okay.
Is that so!
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
That's what I told them.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
That's right.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Yes.  Madame.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
He will be. In about five minutes.
No, a super girl.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's for your own protection.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Let me kiss you.
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Like turning off a light.
But why?
But I don't understand.
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I don't see why not.
She'll forget about us eventually.
What?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Well, just one.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
I could force you.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You're wasting your breath.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Criminals.
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar!
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Oh...I came close once.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
We get together sometimes.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
One.  And a half.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say what?
I don't think you understand.
Columbia.
Columbia.
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
A computer.
Tell me more...
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
What she call you?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about you?
Anytime.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
But the other night...
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Missing????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Be my guest.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, I . . .
I'm listening.
Let's go to my place.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Let's get you inside . . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
North.
Why?
To ski?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Cuba.
Put down Lex Luthor?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
And I will lead.
Stay. I will come to you.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
I'm sorry.
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
This wasn't in the plan.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Shut up, apple-polisher.
You're a great architect, Albert.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
I know.
I will.
No.
Not...gray.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
I just took a shot at it.
Not unless you can fly.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
He's from another world.
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Bingo!
La de da da...
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready.
You?! How about me?
There was a recipe on the back  --
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
Lex is going bye-bye.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
Of course I can. I love you.
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
How good it felt -
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
Otis...
It is for me.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
And garbage doors.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
But you said...
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I'll tell her that.
No you don't.
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
Say hello for me.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Good night.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.
Why?
Well I don't.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
From what?
And what's that?
With our hands.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
I did.
Excuse me?
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Yes.  It's a present.
From you?
It's the truth.
It's like a song.
Yes.
What, Mason?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
People who will help our cause.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Yes.
What for?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
You could see the speedometer?
Why not?
Really?
Of course.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
There's talk of that.
You don't know that.
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I have a message from your sister.
You print them, don't you?
When?
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
He means that much to you...?
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean - integrity?
Talk to her yourself...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
At the bar - Sidney...
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Why did you call me?
Let me try mine.
No way!
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
I would.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
What?
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No problemo.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Drive faster.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Where you going?!
Terminated.
I'm sorry, John.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
Gimme that Phillips right there.
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
So do you.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
No.  There is another chip.
On Furtwängler.
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I have a duty.
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I was warned.
Who warned you?
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Von der Null?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
That's what I asked.
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Show you?
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
So. You wanted to see me.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Alright, the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
I thought you did.
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Freezing.
Come here.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I want it to be over for you.
No.  Never.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her again.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Please, don't do that...
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't think he's breathing.
This can't be real...
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
You should be.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Please...
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Yes... well...
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
I thought...
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Get out.
I didn't say anything.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
I don't know.  A lot.
What do we do?
What... what do you mean?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out!
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
Let me show you...
I have to show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
You need anything?
No.
Really?
You shouldn't have.
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them.  Trust me.
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
How do you know?
Really?
You're part of it...
What?  Connie...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Yeah.
Split it?
Yes.
I hope.
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
It was a different floor then...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
Ilsa... you're alright?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
I'm not sure.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
I'm just like him.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Why are you following me?
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
I checked it personally.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
There's a carriage house around back.
You could have.
Yeah.
You want company?
Maybe someday.
Where in the hell can she be.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
Welcome Home.
I don't know.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No --
How'd I know it was for you?
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
It's okay... we're all here...
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
She was unhappy.
Why?
So far.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
Fifteen dollars.
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
I know.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
No.  The world has missed you.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Red.  What else?
I think so.
Okay.
Just had to be sure.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Not for you, clearly.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
It's not a compliment.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
We all did.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Why not?
Because --
Come over here.
Not bad.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
I wouldn't talk.
Been to the Boat Show.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Eduardo.  Rama.
No reason.
Snuffed her.
Y'what?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
One thing I need.
He's gotta know why.
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
What was that, then?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Where you get your bank statements.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Are you serious.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
What about your grandmother?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Up the coast.
How far?
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Bloke told me.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
So what's your beef, pal?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
What am I doing?
You sure?
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Where else?
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Which kind?
The forever kind.
The L.A.P.D.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
So what.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What?
You bet.
Like what.
I doubt it.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
What do you think?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I don't.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
Hello, Birdy.
That's what he keeps telling me.
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
It's OK...
No. Uh... family friend.
I can get it, yeah.
Way out of line.
Yeah.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
How's business, Dave?
What is it, Dave?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Please, Ed.
Come on in.
I, uh... thanks.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
Ahh...
I didn't say a word.
How are you?
You don't have to tell me anything.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
No thanks.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
No thanks, honey.
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Huh?
Jesus...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Huh? No.
He's the dead guy.
What'd he say?
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Uh... you're under arrest.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
What's the combination?
Let's go!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Mind if I have a look?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Unfortunately, no.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
What is it?
Got my hands full here.
I know.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I'd say we're in its home.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
You must.
What are they?
They're eggs.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Footsteps!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
What is it?
Not that big.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Keep the animal quiet.
Frock's been fired.
What's that?
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
How did you know that?
I don't know.
Behind me.  Over there.
All right.  If you're positive.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Wounded?
The planetarium!
Vince!
It's scared of me.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
No, hold back...
What's on the ClockCam?
He gave it back to his father.
It's just a matter of time.
Why would we--
Sweep the harbor.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Thank you.
Of course.
Certainly a nomination.
I'm the creator.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
Saturday?
I think I've studied enough.
Trust me.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
How do you know?
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on it--or ice?
--we need more charcoal.
What?!
So why do you want to go?
There's been an accident, Truman.
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
Oh, just so.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
You can count on it.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
A woman?  Work.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Agent Mulder.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Looking for him for what?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
Not according to the men in blue.
What did it look like?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
It's locked?
No you didn't.
I'm in the vending room.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
And you're looking for?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Mulder --
I have no idea.
For the purpose of what?
Yeah...?
Run.
Come on!
I don't know.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I think... something stung me.
Where are we?
General McAddie's.
I don't have his number.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I don't know.
I'm not taking any chances.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Is she alive?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
My life is over.  Go.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
I know him.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Yes.  I am.
I can't leave him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Good for them.
I got it.
No problem.
No.  Thank you.
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Initiating connection.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I'll get her...
Yes.
Absolutely.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Now?
Now.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Das worren nooh zeiten.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes.
Why?
Whiskey.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Well you read this.
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
Have you seen Calloway?
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Thank you.
Yes.
That's the reason.
I have never seen him.
No.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
How will I know you?
Thank you.
Been here long?
No.
Once in a while.
No, sorry.
Best thing that ever happened...
Pin it on a...
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Getting around, Martins.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
In Vienna...
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
You all did.
Win what?
Two thirty.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
I know a very good dentist.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
She's been arrested.
And - Anna...
You can get somebody else...
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
What do you want?
Zwei zwartze.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the name of this girl?
But you will.
How do you do.
Vinkel.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
Not necessarily.
English?
Who?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What does he say?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Who else?
Yes.
Yes.
Something wrong.
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Yes.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Never.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Okay.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Good morning.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
There is one problem.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We're ok.
A fin!
Yes.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
Fuck off.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Two.
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
Swim?
Where did you lose it?
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
He's an asshole.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Who the fuck are you?
I don't, but...
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I just read it....
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Killing himself.
Bigger and better.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You want a punch in the mouth?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
You don't own this place.
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
How do you reconcile the two?
The arguments, anyway.
I thought you hated Torah.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
Yes!
Balint?
It's German.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Isn't it true?
Get out of here....
Here...
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
How?
What are you trying to say?
What do you think you should have done?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Funny?
He was funny.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
They're not that Jewish.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
And let us say...
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Does he know?
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
The documents are forged.
Italian is practically the same thing.
Enzo Molinari.
In a lake.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
Don't.
Lira?
Dollars.
Six seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
... What's your name again?
Great!
I don't have one.
... You married?
Forget it.  I was joking.
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
What?
Your mother?
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
What is it?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No!  I would never cheat you.
... I was right about what?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
No... in the hut.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.
I don't know, I just feel it.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
I didn't dive.
... Nothing.
I saw how it has to be.
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Johana... New York.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
What?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
In the spring when he melts!
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
... Yes?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Take a look.
No, it was the perfect level.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Mmm———yes.
Nice fellow?
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Up at the museum.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
Where? Where did you find it?
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Let me see it ——
Tomorrow -—
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
I want to ask you something.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
We're old friends.
More or less.
Yes.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
And not a sign of the leopard?
Yes.
That doesn't make sense.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know -- Teresa -—
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
That might depend on where you’re going.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
That depends what you’re looking at.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Sorry?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
Something like that?
Something like that.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Yeah.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Do you know a friendly cop?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Have we done business before?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
What?
Where are we?
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
I hope it’s not too significant.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
My rates...
We conclude our transaction.
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Don’t jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Should I come back in five minutes?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Excuse me?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Viens.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Alors quoi?
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Three...
So why didn’t he?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Shut up and walk...
What do you think?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
What do you mean?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Come with me...
Jeanne, no...
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
To be killed in battle?
It would not be the same without you.
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
Good.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Quite a few.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Where... where am I?
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
I'll be right here... I promise.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
You have nothing to regret...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Thanks be to God.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Does he have hair?
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
Sooner is better than later!
We're taking back the Tourelles!
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Good idea...
No good?  This is a disaster!
The English are rebuilding it.
Perfectly.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
The clothes are not important...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Because... because you just can't!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Who gave you that horse?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Who?
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
Yes, it is.
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Only God knows the answer to that.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
He'll be back before curfew.
Just over a year.
Dead.
What are you doing?
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
What?
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help?
It costs.
I've no money.
Who's recruiting?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
That makes a change.
They were taking you away.
You'll be deported.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Can you help? I've no money...
Wladek! How are you?
Cow!
Pig!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
In the attic.
Show me.
We're getting out.
Not yet.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You don't want to learn.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
They are washed.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
Hello.
She never gives him a turn.
Do I know any gigs?
Play a song then
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
He'll probably fall down.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
You got a bag or somethin?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
That's the way I want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Good lad.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
You know anything about him?
If we ever get to it.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
He'll show.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
That's why he won't know it.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 500.
What are the odds on Syphon?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Where's June today?
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
What do you mean?
Then why the rat?
Maybe a couple million.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I don't know, figure something out.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
I think he will.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
I'm sorry.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Nothing.
Another young man.
It's the same one.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
Why not?
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
Hello, there!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
tried him once -
There. 
Why... in the heart.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
If you think it'll be all right.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
He's all right.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Was there much blood?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
Who's is it?
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
I'll take care of him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
He did!
About three.
Did you go?
Goodbye.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
I didn't mean you, Mister.
You've said that for weeks.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Never mind.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
What did you do with the rest?
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
You're always teasing.
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
What are you drinking?
I'd like to see you work.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
I'll get some towels. 
Yeah.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
Macaulay.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
But Wynant --- ?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What are you going to do?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Sure.
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You did.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
Wha...
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Break it out.
Yeah.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Let me see the map.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Move!
I heard!
What about it?
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
It's a combat action.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don't go for that?
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
Knock it off!
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Oh, that's fun.
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
I got that...sir.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing here?
Something like that.
Just stay down.
They're going to kill us!
So where do we start?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
What?
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
They'll search the pack.
And you; you've got it all together.
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, I guess we should.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Yeah.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
What?
He's going to slow down.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
What?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
What!?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Oh, God!
Yeah, well, we're not.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
I think we found something.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Correct.  Origin?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Correct.
What happened?
4732...?
Now.
Now?
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Don't go.
Don't be so sure.
I'll try.
I don't know.
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
What?
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
What?
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
Look!
...and you're not lost now?
That way.
Look more closely.
What?
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
I don't care.
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
All right...
Where's LUH?
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
I thought of something.....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
No thanks, Bev.
Go ahead.
Just do it.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
I don't know. You tell me?
`Til we get a better lead.
Be right back.
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
What do we do?
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
I don't know.
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Reilly! He's loaded!
He's my brother...
Alex-
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay in the truck.
What? Nobody, I-
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuck factor ten.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Don't talk.
Ain't that a shit--
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
That feeling won't last long.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
<u>Niente!</u>
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
No, not at all!
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You say I am a crook.
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
No, Captain, I tell you--
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Oh!
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
No. What is it? Tell me.
As you like. 
Beautiful specimen.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
You're hired!
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Good night.
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Goodbye.
Yes, Madame Colet?
Yes--uh--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
Please!  Thank you.
May I?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Well, where is it?
An hour, two at most.
You're certain?
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
What do I tell your mother?
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
Almost as good as you.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
We've struck ice.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
May I?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Au contraire, mon cher.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Could it have damaged the ship?
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Never let go.
You had it the entire time?!
It would be a nice change from you.
This is Miss Marsh.
That's a date. 
We'll save you a place at our table.
I think you do.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Where's Lother?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Get moving--
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Want to take it back?
Yes--
Very much--
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
How about giving me another coat?
There's soft music--
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Very--your mother?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Sorry.
Thanks.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
What's the matter?
I thought you were a smart guy.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
A dollar forty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Change?
Are you screwy?
I'll take one. 
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Get it!
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
I'll go with you.
Thanks. That makes us square.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What'll I say?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
So what?
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Just what the doctor ordered.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very--
You don't shoot squirrels.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
About twelve hundred.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Thank you.
"Smooth's" the word.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Ain't got time.
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Then why did you run away?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Not now.  I don't have time.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Good.  That's real good.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Excuse me?
You retired, too?
Yeah, you look it.

It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.

I forgave you the moment you said it.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
You wanted to talk?
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Not anymore, not after this.
Drop his horse.
We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Fine.  Better.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
So to speak.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
- Four wheel drive?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Is this another one of your games?
Just hold me.
Well... If you insist.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Let's take a look at the body.
Step into my office.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
That's reassuring.
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
Depends what number you write.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
You too.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Blood or Dutch?
You are seriously deranged.
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
Don't say it.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
It doesn't quite add up.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
Start the grinders.
You have to leave -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Will the cruise set it off?
Oh here we go with that.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
My name is Sam. Samuel.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was nip and tuck.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
It would be nice.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Tolerable well.
Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You can bring ONE toy...
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
Woody!  Buzz!
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
You can't!
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
You mean that happy child?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Go away.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
What?!
Woody!  The rocket!
The match!
Hold still, Buzz!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I got dibs on his hat!
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
I don't know!
What?
Look!  Janie!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
You murdering dog!
No, no, no, wait!
I was close to being scared that time.
Okay, save your batteries!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
That's right.  Your toys.
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Speed up!
There's no mirror.
Excuse me.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Home is where the heart is.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
Ah, come on now!
I'm cold.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
In my pocket.
Surely she is older?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
So did I.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.
You're late for breakfast.
He's not here.
Nine thousand dollars.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, thank God.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
What?
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
Me, too.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
Oh, yes I can.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like.  It is.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Who do you work for?
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
I don't know.
Depends who it's from.
We're playing!
Yes, sir!
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
I don't know.  Something.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
What?
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
It was an anonymous tip.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I got money.
She hasn't called you?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Agents who died in the field.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late, like.
You were in my way.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
Can you not go yourself.
I guess you would, Franco.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
What?
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Out.
Come on.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Can I see you again?
Are you clean?
Yes.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Happy birthday.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It's an interesting theory.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No. Me Neither.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Yeah.
Nightmare.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
Why, thank you.
Yeah.
Are you serious?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
A walk.
But where?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
You doubt me?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Position, Bird of Prey?
But the shuttle-
I don't have a clue.
A Federation starship.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Let us explore it together.
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
If we could send a distress signal...
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
Are we leaving, Captain?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
But he does seem familiar?
Who is it he reminds you of?
To land any closer would risk detection.
Yes, Captain?
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
That's a little vague, Spock -
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Uh-uh.
It must be all those marsh melons.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I'll take you to the bridge.
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.





  




Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
I belong here.
You haven't told him?
Hi, Flynn.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
You call that getting over it?
To warn him.
Of what?
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
End of line.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
How about you?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Recognizers!
Alan-One...

Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
End of line.
Do it!
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
I had to...in the games...
We have to get off this beam!
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
I have a book report.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
In the helicopter.
What?
Here, check these out.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Sorry.
Yes what?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Yes.
Why?
Louder please.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No.  Doris.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
You wouldn't believe me.
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going! 
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.

Yes.  Now go.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.

Nope.
He wants to speak with you.

Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Now hang up.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Thanks a lot.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Would you like to get some pie?
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
What kinda music do you like?
That's a long time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Thank you.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
I just gotta get somethin'.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Live with what?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Who the fuck are you?
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
It'll get ya high.
I certainly hope so.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.
Yeah?
In case of what?
Really?
Yeah, OK.
The police department?
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
No.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
We grew up together.
That's about all I ever eat.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I got some money I can give you -
I give up. Who are you?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
Could we try it now?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Uh-huh.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
He saw the wire.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Rock whores.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
Put it in your pants.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Sorta room-mates?
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, what?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
I need to go.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
July?!
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
What?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Lock it now!
Jeffrey Mason?
The gun! ... I lost it
Just like that?  You were in prison?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
That's my morning's pay.
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
What?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
We ain't got no Beck's.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Did you like it; me watching you?
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
Such as?
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
I can't.
Jake.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
There has to be!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
What about him?
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
You killed him!
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Grace!
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
The trunk.  It's locked.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Husband . . .?
Grace, tell him.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Hungry?
No.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a thick change of heart.
I said come on!
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Not as bad as it looks.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Grace, tell him.
It ain't broke.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
Live there?
Would I what?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Hundred-fifty.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
You got the money?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I like that about me, beautiful.
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I didn't say it bothered me.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
There is no us, remember?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I'm not coming back.
But I thought --
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
My mother died in this canyon.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Get in.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
What kind?
Beck's.
You didn't hear something?
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
I said come on!
Is Noel in?
No.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
out again?
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
We're supposed to be honest.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
We've already begun.
Is there a problem?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
But not a knife?
I don't know what you're asking?
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Yes he is.
Just one--
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
Two hundred and seventy.
There's no more left?
That's great.
Do you know why?
Know what?
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
Is David Dunne there?
Was your family traveling with you?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where is it?
But what they done, they...
You told them cowboys you had it.
Thank God.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
'Course he's coming.
Oh. How long I been here?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Yeah. See?
She back in Kansas?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh yeah.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
All week?
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
I could run off them whores.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Yeah, I guess so.
About what?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
You don't recollect!
He got the boy's horse.
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
Yeah.
After a ways.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
Yup.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Yeah.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You better get on back, Miss.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
He hit you?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Two more hogs got the fever.
Did I what?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Who said that?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
You gonna share your half with him?
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
We'll bury him.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Hell, yeah.
There's more.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Alright.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Maybe more.
No killing?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Soze will be most -
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Where?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.  It would be.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
We just ...
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
And you wrote that...
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Why is that?
I was held up.
That's perfectly all right.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Yes.  It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Do you want me to go...?
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
You got a good memory, Franky.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked?
... You saw her?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
You don't have to do it for a living.
And you like it.
No, I'm all right.
Someone dead.
It's not my line.
Yes.
She is not my wife.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
You.
Why?
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Okay.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
No? Then what?
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
All in good time.
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
Why?
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
We'll find him.
I loved you, Madeleine.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
At...
Oh... wandering about.
You like it, too.
I... didn't know where you lived.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
I enjoyed talking to you.
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Shopping?
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
When?
Long ago...
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
Where?
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
Only this far.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
And it's a all real.
Let me go.
Where?
What car?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
Oh!
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Okay.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
And she died...
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
Carlotta?
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Where?
Around.
Oh?
Did you need it?
Oh?
What I've been doing?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
How?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
But you said grey, sir.
I thought so!
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Excellent.
I need a drink.
What?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
You're an asshole.
Name one.
I don't have to...
Why was the floor wet?
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You don't know what you're doing.
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
So I didn't fucking do it!
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
We've already done this.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I got children. I've got a life.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
There is no candy!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No. I think it's fucked.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
What happened? Oh my God...
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
So where's that leave us?
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
The groom?
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
Not tonight.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
I said, what have we done?
What?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
Then what do they have?
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
We're not goosed.
Goosed!
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
Are we going to do this again?
How do you figure?
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
It's vile!
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Of course.
Hi.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I know.
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
Do you love me?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
What does that mean?
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Move the bodies?
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
You're not breathing right?
He's your brother.
So?
Go for it.
Come on.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
What?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
"You Send Me."
A mutant species.
Okay boys, smile!
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
That's right.
No, the children sleep with me.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
That one.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Who is she?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Don't go!
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
She won't even know.
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
Good.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
What are you going to do?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Things seem to be getting better.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Why not?
There's been an accident.
I'm afraid.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
Yes -- very, very big!
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
Good, then let's go!
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.
From the terrace.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Fine —— you want to stay here?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Not from in here.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
This is my area of expertise.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That's why I'm asking.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
What are you saying...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
...can we have a white one...?
Can we have a white one, please...
What'd ya think?
Indeed it is.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
...where?
Come on.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
Who's got the story? 
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
Tell me again.
The American "people"?
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
Why?
Precisely.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...what's the Long View?
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
...Stanley Moss...
...brazen-it-through...
The War is Over.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Never quit a winner.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Heavy weather East of here.
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
...uh ... No, that's...
The... 
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
President's speech.
I saw it on TV.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Leopard Skin...
No, he's back in Nashville.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
No problem.  Here's the...
You like it?
Yes.
Fine.  Good.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
A beret.
Why a beret?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Why...?
Show some compassion.
Is today Laundry Day...?
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
a "pond," or
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
The FAA announcement.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon.
Upper West Side.
You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
He still likes you
Businessman!
Yeah 
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you Jenkins
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Good evening sir.
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Vell.  Goodnight.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Go away.
Right behind you.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Six six and six
Maybe before the event, never after.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
I know that.
Of course you will.
No, he wouldn't.
So much.
I started seeing things.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Because he was worried about me.
You're joking.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
You think that'll help?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
No.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Toward the end.  You remember?
The wives.
Um...
She isn't here.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
I didn't kill my wife.
Um...yes.
I'm not...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
I've never even met you.
You do?
Right.  I'm sorry.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Yeah.
No, I don't.
Claire.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
I should be going anyway.
This is...
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
Good.  I'm good.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
It's niiice.
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
This.
Shhh.
M-E...
Jody, wait.
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Please.
Jody he was lying.
Three weeks.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
I am, really.
You know what I mean.
I know.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Shhh.
I'll be there.
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
Hurry...
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You are so brilliant.
You know what that does to me.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
"...for my father."
What?  No.  No.
What's going on, Claire?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Who did?
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
Really big bed.
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
Yes.  The ghost.
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
What?
Claire--
That's not what I'm sayi--
To Caitlin!!
What?
How can you be sure?
What?
Don't think so.
Nothing.
You don't have to do that.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
:Well, they are.
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
Two heartbeats.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Michael, Rowan should -
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
There are things I have to know!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
He just went out like & light-
Like this...?
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
Harder...
My jury's still out on that,
Rowan...
HARDER!
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Did you see the old man on the ---
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You can't just -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Yes - I have had it for years.
I really don't know what to say
I'm sorry?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
No she didn't...
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
Yes - I suppose so...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
Yes...?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes - one please.
Not ever. Never.
I better go, Dad.
Check it out!
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Take a whiff of heaven.
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
We reinvented ourselves.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Yeah? You like?
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
I mean, what do you think?
Of course we are.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
The one with the horses.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
I meant biologically.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
In what sense?
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I see.
I doubt it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Come on.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
Forget the store. Think big.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
I have only one concern...
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You're sure?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I'm just a messenger.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Back to the land of grownups.
I net a guy in a bar.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Where's the body?
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You are.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
Yes.  God, Mom...
In back of the garage.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
Hello.
Say you love me.
You think that's wise?
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Will they?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
The one you bought at school.
That's right.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Didn't you see her this morning?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Jim West.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Always hoping.  Or this...
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
My disguise.  And here...
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Yes.  Now, observe....
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
It's better than nothing.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's a town!
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
My pleasure.
I know!  I know!
Where have you been?
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
The first.
Yes!
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It is?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Just get me some horses.
Let's go.
Yes...?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Let me see it.
Why not?
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
I will!  But I need help!
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I hate this.
Absolutely!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I thought you had her!
I won't.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Well what did she say?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Ahhh!
No!
Kill him!
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
Shhhhh!
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Just do it!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Courage, Willow.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I changed her already!
Who is he?
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Just do it!
It's been a while.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
You know who?
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
Just us.
Move! Or you die right here!
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
You tell him. When you're able.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
Oh. The bullets.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
I was being foolish?
Aren't you? After today?
That's God's way!
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Make that 1790.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But... if you had to guess?
John said you're Amish.
Oh.
You didn't have to...
His name is John Book.
Looks dead...
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
All right, where is he?
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh -- all right.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Catch him, you fool!
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
What's she doing now?
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Did you say something?
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh --
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Look -- it ticks!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Huh?  What'd he say?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I don't know.
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
Now...
Yeah!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
You know something?
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, no!
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Elektra King.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I’m sorry.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You’re not going to.
It’s the only way out...
I know.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
...you should rest.
Then take me with you.
No. You’ll be safe here.
I don’t want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Oh James.
You, of course. I need some information.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
A rope!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
No!  Get me out!
Istanbul.
How appropriate.
Bond!
Could...could you come?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
What do you think?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Please.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Cured, yes.
Veidt¹s complex.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
What if you¹re wrong??
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
His . . . whatever.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
What are you up to?
Don't look.  Turn around.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I'm sorry about Blake.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
What are you talking about?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I can see that. Why?
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
We all do.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Uh-huh.
I wanted to talk to you.
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
What if they're naughty?
What do you say?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes himself seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Senator?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
To find Rogue.
How?
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
How?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
From your office, sir.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir?
What?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Hello...?
Miss me?
I...
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Promise??
I promise.
Very....very!
Whatever makes you happy.
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Love me?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
A week.  Ten days at most.
I didn't do that.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, just the two.
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
Wockers with the knockers???
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
How?
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
That's not bad.
Thank you, Master.
This guy means business.
Wait till he sees the bill.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
You can say that again.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Can you play it?
That's what we're paid for.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I think I'll...carry him.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Give him the sedative!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Do Something!  Stall them!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Yes.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
